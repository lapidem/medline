INSTRUCTIONS for installing medline.py (ELIZA system)

*** ELIZA console version, medline.py, rev6.3, 2018 (c) sirasawa ***
ELIZA system can work only on python3 not on python2.

[Windows]
1. Install anaconda3 by an installer, Anaconda3-5.1.0-Windows-x86_64.exe
	Anaconda3 folder should be installed into your directory. 
	e.g.) C:\users\sirasawa\Anaconda3\
1.1	install python libraries below (on the Anaconda prompt)
	pip install pyperclip
	pip install readchar
	replace \Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\readchar\readchar_windows with readchar_windows in the distribution.
	(currently distributed readchar_windows.py has a minor bug that causes crash.)

2. Install ConEmu by an installer, ConEmuSetup.161206.exe
3. Install WordNet by an installer, WordNet-2.1.exe
4. Copy 'pubmed' folder into your home folder. e.g.)C:\users\sirasawa\
5. Start ConEmu, invoke 'settings...' in the menu, and import 'medline.xml' included in the distribution.
6. Start ELIZA (medline.py) pushing '+' the icon on the ConEmu.
7. On the first run, make the database by typing '.o' or O)pen Medline text data in the menu.
8. Menu of ELIZA can be invoked by '.', and the usage will be shown by typing '.u'.

[LINUX]
[OS-X]
Procedures are almost the same as in 'Windows'. 
Brief instructions for experts (probably you are:).
1. Install anaconda
	also install python libraries, pyperclip, readchar by pip.
	Unfortunately, conda doesn't support both of the libraries.
2. Install wordnet, which is usually included in the distribution that you are using. 
	Make sure to set up as you can call 'wn'.
	In the case of OS-X, you may need homebrew.
		brew cask install quartz
		brew install wordnet
3. Copy pubmed folder into your home directory.
	Make sure to set up the path to ~/pubmed/, 
	or as you can call 'medline.py' and 'readkbd.py' in the pubmed directory.
4. Call ELIZA by 'medline.py'.


[USAGE]
ELIZA supports bash-like cursor movements familiar to Linux and OS-X users, which is not explained here.
 ********** Eliza HELP *************
Eliza does DEEP NEURAL NET SEARCH of words in Medline db.
Eliza already knows the words and the frequencies of their use.
MENU: . for invoking menu
Separating keywords with ':' makes Eliza report MULTIPLE searches
instead of DEEP NEURAL NET SEARCH.
DO NOT include  [+, *, (, ), {, }, [, ], ?, <, >] in keywords.
TIPs: one keyword followd by ':' makes the search SIMPLE SEARCH.
SHORTCUTS:
the NUMBER of 'words associated' invokes the keywords.
e.g.) 1:2 invokes MULTIPLE SEARCH with 1st and 2nd keywords.
']'+ NUMBER allows Eliza copy the line to the clipboard.
'.h' for history, '.number' for invoking (number)history directly
    e.g.) '.0' for previous search
'.k' for KWIC toggle, defaut ON
'.r'+keyword for REGULAR EXPRESSION for experts
    example: '.rThis.+study' matches 'This is the first study', etc.
'.v', '.a', '.j' for invoking lists of verb, adverb, adjective, respectively.
'.w' invoking Wordnet
'.u' for Usage, '.i' for info
'.o' for open and intake the Medline.txt databases in "pumed folder".
'.l' for load data, manually.
'.s' save data, manually.
'.q' for quit
Eliza makes '~/.medline.db' and '~/.medline.txt'

******** multiple search mode usage********
'a':jump to the start point     'p':previous list
'e':jump to the end             'CR':return for next list
'l':toggle sort mode(sort: by right side, Lsort: by left side)
'k':toggle KWIC mode          'j':jump 1/10 leap
'b':jump back 1/10 leap       'f':shows frequent neighbors
'C':copy all lists to clipboard  'h':invoke this page
'w':invoking wordnet
']number':copy numbered list to clipboard
any other key to quit

********** Have a fun! *************

[How to manipulate medline databases]
You can add and remove database by changing the *.txt in the pubmed folder.
Using 'PUBMED' on line, you should download searched papers in 'medline' format as follows.
-----
The extension should be 'txt'.
In the PubMed, search papers,
'Send to' > 'File' > choose format 'MEDLINE'
push 'Create File' button.
Downloading starts.
Rename the downloaded file as '*.txt' and move into your 'pubmed' folder.
Invoke open in ELIZA by typing '.o', and taking the medline data into your database begins.
