AB  - High-risk Human Papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is the causative agent of different human
      cancers. A persistent HR-HPV infection alters several cellular processes involved
      in cell proliferation, apoptosis, immune evasion, genomic instability and
      transformation. Cumulative evidence from past studies indicates that HR-HPV
      proteins are associated with oxidative stress (OS) and has been proposed as a
      risk factor for cancer development. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS)
      regulate a plethora of processes inducing cellular proliferation, differentiation
      and death. Oxidative stress (OS) is generated when an imbalance in the redox
      state occurs due to deregulation of the oxidant and antioxidant systems, which,
      in turn, promotes the damage of DNA, proteins and lipids, allowing the
      accumulation of mutations and genome instability. OS has been associated with the
      establishment and development of different cancers, and it has recently been
      proposed as a co-factor in cervical cancer development. This review is focused on
      evidence regarding the association of OS with HR-HPV proteins, and the interplay 
      of the viral proteins with different elements of the antioxidant and DNA damage
      response (DDR) systems, emphasizing the processes that might be required for the 
      viral life cycle and viral DNA integration into the host genome, which is a key
      element in the carcinogenic process induced by HR-HPV.

TI  - The ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) Protein Kinase Pathway is Activated by Herpes
      Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) and Required for Efficient Viral Replication.
LID - JVI.01884-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01884-17 [doi]
AB  - The ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) protein kinase, and its downstream effector Chk1, 
      are key sensors and organizers of the DNA damage response (DDR) to a variety of
      insults. Previous studies of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) showed no evidence
      for activation of the ATR pathway. Here we demonstrate that both Chk1 and ATR
      were phosphorylated by 3 h.p.i.. Activation of ATR and Chk1 was observed using 4 
      different HSV-1 strains in multiple cell types, while a specific ATR inhibitor
      blocked activation. Mechanistic studies point to early viral gene expression as a
      key trigger for ATR activation. Both pATR and pChk1 localized to the nucleus
      within viral replication centers, or associated with their periphery, by 3
      h.p.i.. Significant levels of pATR and pChk1 were also detected in the cytoplasm 
      where they co-localized with ICP4 and ICP0. Proximity ligation assays confirmed
      that pATR and pChk1 were closely and specifically associated with ICP4 and ICP0
      in both the nucleus and cytoplasm by 3 h.p.i., but not with ICP8 or ICP27,
      presumably in a multiprotein complex. Chemically distinct ATR and Chk1 inhibitors
      blocked HSV-1 replication and infectious virion production, while inhibitors of
      ATM, Chk2, and DNA-PK did not. Together our data show that HSV-1 activates the
      ATR pathway at early stages of infection, and that ATR and Chk1 kinase activities
      play important roles in HSV-1 replication fitness. These findings indicate that
      the ATR pathway may provide insight for therapeutic approaches.IMPORTANCE Viruses
      have evolved complex associations with cellular DNA damage response (DDR)
      pathways, which sense troublesome DNA structures formed during infection. The
      first evidence for activation of the ATR pathway by HSV-1 is presented. ATR is
      activated, and its downstream target Chk1 is robustly phosphorylated, during
      early stages of infection. Both activated proteins are found in the nucleus
      associated with viral replication compartments, and in the cytoplasm associated
      with viral proteins. We also demonstrate that both ATR and Chk1 kinase activities
      are important for viral replication. The findings suggest that HSV-1 activates
      ATR and Chk1 during early stages of infection, and utilizes the enzymes to
      promote its own replication. The observation may be exploitable for antiviral
      approaches.

TI  - How Human Papillomavirus Replication and Immune Evasion Strategies Take Advantage
      of the Host DNA Damage Repair Machinery.
LID - E390 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v9120390 [doi]
AB  - The DNA damage response (DDR) is a complex signalling network activated when DNA 
      is altered by intrinsic or extrinsic agents. DDR plays important roles in genome 
      stability and cell cycle regulation, as well as in tumour transformation. Viruses
      have evolved successful life cycle strategies in order to ensure a chronic
      persistence in the host, virtually avoiding systemic sequelae and death. This
      process promotes the periodic shedding of large amounts of infectious particles
      to maintain a virus reservoir in individual hosts, while allowing virus spreading
      within the community. To achieve such a successful lifestyle, the human papilloma
      virus (HPV) needs to escape the host defence systems. The key to understanding
      how this is achieved is in the virus replication process that provides by itself 
      an evasion mechanism by inhibiting and delaying the host immune response against 
      the viral infection. Numerous studies have demonstrated that HPV exploits both
      the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia-telangiectasia and
      rad3-related (ATR) DDR pathways to replicate its genome and maintain a persistent
      infection by downregulating the innate and cell-mediated immunity. This review
      outlines how HPV interacts with the ATM- and ATR-dependent DDR machinery during
      the viral life cycle to create an environment favourable to viral replication,
      and how the interaction with the signal transducers and activators of
      transcription (STAT) protein family and the deregulation of the Janus kinase
      (JAK)-STAT pathways may impact the expression of interferon-inducible genes and
      the innate immune responses.

TI  - Characterization of the EBV-Induced Persistent DNA Damage Response.
LID - E366 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v9120366 [doi]
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus that is ubiquitous in the
      human population. Early after EBV infection in vitro, primary human B cells
      undergo a transient period of hyper-proliferation, which results in replicative
      stress and DNA damage, activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway and,
      ultimately, senescence. In this study, we investigated DDR-mediated senescence in
      early arrested EBV-infected B cells and characterized the establishment of
      persistent DNA damage foci. We found that arrested EBV-infected B cells exhibited
      an increase in promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs), which
      predominantly localized to markers of DNA damage, as well as telomeric DNA.
      Furthermore, arrested EBV-infected B cells exhibited an increase in the presence 
      of telomere dysfunction-induced foci. Importantly, we found that increasing human
      telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression with danazol, a drug used to 
      treat telomere diseases, permitted early EBV-infected B cells to overcome
      cellular senescence and enhanced transformation. Finally, we report that
      EBV-infected B cells undergoing hyper-proliferation are more sensitive than
      lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) to inhibition of Bloom syndrome-associated
      helicase, which facilitates telomere replication. Together, our results describe 
      the composition of persistent DNA damage foci in the early stages of EBV
      infection and define key regulators of this barrier to long-term outgrowth.

TI  - Epstein-Barr Virus Hijacks DNA Damage Response Transducers to Orchestrate Its
      Life Cycle.
LID - E341 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v9110341 [doi]
AB  - The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous virus that infects most of the human
      population. EBV infection is associated with multiple human cancers, including
      Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, a subset of gastric carcinomas, and
      almost all undifferentiated non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Intensive 
      research has shown that EBV triggers a DNA damage response (DDR) during primary
      infection and lytic reactivation. The EBV-encoded viral proteins have been
      implicated in deregulating the DDR signaling pathways. The consequences of DDR
      inactivation lead to genomic instability and promote cellular transformation.
      This review summarizes the current understanding of the relationship between EBV 
      infection and the DDR transducers, including ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated),
      ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), and DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase), and
      discusses how EBV manipulates the DDR signaling pathways to complete the
      replication process of viral DNA during lytic reactivation.

LID - E342 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v9110342 [doi]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) has extensive interactions with the host DNA
      damage response (DDR) machinery that can be either detrimental or beneficial to
      the virus. Proteins in the homologous recombination pathway are known to be
      required for efficient replication of the viral genome, while different members
      of the classical non-homologous end-joining (c-NHEJ) pathway have opposing
      effects on HSV-1 infection. Here, we have investigated the role of the
      recently-discovered c-NHEJ component, PAXX (Paralogue of XRCC4 and XLF), which we
      found to be excluded from the nucleus during HSV-1 infection. We have established
      that cells lacking PAXX have an intact innate immune response to HSV-1 but show a
      defect in viral genome replication efficiency. Counterintuitively, PAXX(-/-)
      cells were able to produce greater numbers of infectious virions, indicating that
      PAXX acts to restrict HSV-1 infection in a manner that is different from other
      c-NHEJ factors.

TI  - Protoparvovirus Interactions with the Cellular DNA Damage Response.
LID - E323 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v9110323 [doi]
AB  - Protoparvoviruses are simple single-stranded DNA viruses that infect many animal 
      species. The protoparvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM) infects murine and
      transformed human cells provoking a sustained DNA damage response (DDR). This DDR
      is dependent on signaling by the ATM kinase and leads to a prolonged pre-mitotic 
      cell cycle block that features the inactivation of ATR-kinase mediated signaling,
      proteasome-targeted degradation of p21, and inhibition of cyclin B1 expression.
      This review explores how protoparvoviruses, and specifically MVM, co-opt the
      common mechanisms regulating the DDR and cell cycle progression in order to
      prepare the host nuclear environment for productive infection.

TI  - Hepatitis B Virus and DNA Damage Response: Interactions and Consequences for the 
      Infection.
LID - E304 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v9100304 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major etiologic agent of acute and chronic
      hepatitis, and end-stage liver disease. Establishment of HBV infection,
      progression to persistency and pathogenesis are determined by viral and cellular 
      factors, some of which remain still undefined. Key steps of HBV life cycle e.g., 
      transformation of genomic viral DNA into transcriptionally active episomal DNA
      (cccDNA) or transcription of viral mRNAs from cccDNA, take place in the nucleus
      of infected cells and strongly depend on enzymatic activities provided by
      cellular proteins. In this regard, DNA damage response (DDR) pathways and some
      DDR proteins are being recognized as important factors regulating the infection. 
      On one hand, HBV highjacks specific DDR proteins to successfully complete some of
      the steps of its life cycle. On the other hand, HBV subverts DDR pathways to
      presumably create a cellular environment that favours its replication. Direct
      consequences of these interactions are: HBV DNA integration into host chromosomal
      DNA, and accumulation of mutations in host chromosomal DNA that could eventually 
      trigger carcinogenic processes, which would explain in part the incidence of
      hepatocellular carcinoma in chronically infected patients. Unravelling the
      interactions that HBV establishes with DDR pathways might help identify new
      molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Resveratrol inhibits Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma through activation of DNA
      damage response pathway.
PG  - 133
LID - 10.1186/s13046-017-0601-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a highly aggressive
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma with poor prognosis. Resveratrol (RSV,
      3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene), a natural nontoxic phenolic compound found in the
      skin of grapes and some other spermatophytes, performs multiple bioactivities,
      such as antioxidant activity, anti-aging activity, reduction of cardiovascular
      disease risk and anticarcinogenic effect. Here we report the anti-tumor effect of
      RSV in NKTCL cell lines SNT-8, SNK-10 and SNT-16. RESULTS: RSV inhibited NKTCL
      cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner and arrested cell cycle
      at S phase. It induced NKTCL cells apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway, shown
      as down-regulation of MCl-1 and survivin, up-regulation of Bax and Bad, and
      activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. In addition, we found that RSV suppressed 
      the phosphorylation level of AKT and Stat3, and activated DNA damage response
      (DDR) pathway directly or through up-regulation of Zta of Epstein-Barr virus
      (EBV). Furthermore, using KU55933 as the inhibitor of pATM, we verified that DDR 
      played an important role in RSV inducing NKTCL apoptosis. RSV also showed
      synergistic effect on activating DDR pathway in combination with etoposide or
      ionizing radiation, which resulted in cell proliferation inhibition and
      apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide in vitro evidence that RSV produces
      anti-tumor effect by activating DDR pathway in an ATM/Chk2/p53 dependent manner. 
      So we suggest that RSV may be worthy for further study as an anti-tumor drug for 
      NKTCL treatment.

TI  - Why Human Papillomaviruses Activate the DNA Damage Response (DDR) and How
      Cellular and Viral Replication Persists in the Presence of DDR Signaling.
LID - E268 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v9100268 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) require the activation of the DNA damage response
      (DDR) in order to undergo a successful life cycle. This activation presents a
      challenge for the virus and the infected cell: how does viral and host
      replication proceed in the presence of a DDR that ordinarily arrests replication;
      and how do HPV16 infected cells retain the ability to proliferate in the presence
      of a DDR that ordinarily arrests the cell cycle? This raises a further question: 
      why do HPV activate the DDR? The answers to these questions are only partially
      understood; a full understanding could identify novel therapeutic strategies to
      target HPV cancers. Here, we propose that the rapid replication of an 8 kb double
      stranded circular genome during infection creates aberrant DNA structures that
      attract and activate DDR proteins. Therefore, HPV replication in the presence of 
      an active DDR is a necessity for a successful viral life cycle in order to
      resolve these DNA structures on viral genomes; without an active DDR, successful 
      replication of the viral genome would not proceed. We discuss the essential role 
      of TopBP1 in this process and also how viral and cellular replication proceeds in
      HPV infected cells in the presence of DDR signals.

AB  - Viruses regulate cellular processes to facilitate viral replication. Manipulation
      of nuclear proteins and pathways by nuclear replicating viruses often causes
      cellular genome instability that contributes to transformation. The cellular DNA 
      damage response (DDR) safeguards the host to maintain genome integrity, but DNA
      tumour viruses can manipulate the DDR to promote viral propagation. In this
      review, we describe the interactions of DNA tumour viruses with the
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein kinase (PIKK) pathways, which are
      central regulatory arms of the DDR. We review how signalling through the ataxia
      telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR), and
      DNA-dependent protein kinases (DNA-PK) influences viral life cycles, and how
      their manipulation by viral proteins may contribute to tumour formation.This
      article is part of the themed issue 'Human oncogenic viruses'.

TI  - Localization of Double-Strand Break Repair Proteins to Viral Replication
      Compartments following Lytic Reactivation of Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated
      Herpesvirus.
LID - e00930-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00930-17 [doi]
AB  - Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA are recognized by the Ku70/80 heterodimer and 
      the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex and result in activation of the DNA-PK and ATM
      kinases, which play key roles in regulating the cellular DNA damage response
      (DDR). DNA tumor viruses such as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)
      are known to interact extensively with the DDR during the course of their
      replicative cycles. Here we show that during lytic amplification of KSHV DNA, the
      Ku70/80 heterodimer and the MRN complex consistently colocalize with viral
      genomes in replication compartments (RCs), whereas other DSB repair proteins form
      foci outside RCs. Depletion of MRE11 and abrogation of its exonuclease activity
      negatively impact viral replication, while in contrast, knockdown of Ku80 and
      inhibition of the DNA-PK enzyme, which are involved in nonhomologous end joining 
      (NHEJ) repair, enhance amplification of viral DNA. Although the recruitment of
      DSB-sensing proteins to KSHV RCs is a consistent occurrence across multiple cell 
      types, activation of the ATM-CHK2 pathway during viral replication is a cell
      line-specific event, indicating that recognition of viral DNA by the DDR does not
      necessarily result in activation of downstream signaling pathways. We have also
      observed that newly replicated viral DNA is not associated with cellular
      histones. Since the presence and modification of these DNA-packaging proteins
      provide a scaffold for docking of multiple DNA repair factors, the absence of
      histone deposition may allow the virus to evade localization of DSB repair
      proteins that would otherwise have a detrimental effect on viral
      replication.IMPORTANCE Tumor viruses are known to interact with machinery
      responsible for detection and repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA,
      although detail concerning how Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)
      modulates these cellular pathways during its lytic replication phase was
      previously lacking. By undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the localization
      of DSB repair proteins during KSHV replication, we have determined that a DNA
      damage response (DDR) is directed to viral genomes but is distinct from the
      response to cellular DNA damage. We also demonstrate that although recruitment of
      the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) DSB-sensing complex to viral genomes and activation of
      the ATM kinase can promote KSHV replication, proteins involved in nonhomologous
      end joining (NHEJ) repair restrict amplification of viral DNA. Overall, this
      study extends our understanding of the virus-host interactions that occur during 
      lytic replication of KSHV and provides a deeper insight into how the DDR is
      manipulated during viral infection.

PG  - 2657-2662
LID - 10.1242/jcs.204909 [doi]
AB  - Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare disease, in which homozygous or compound
      heterozygous inactivating mutations in any of 21 genes lead to genomic
      instability, early-onset bone marrow failure and increased cancer risk. The FA
      pathway is essential for DNA damage response (DDR) to DNA interstrand crosslinks.
      However, proteins of the FA pathway have additional cytoprotective functions that
      may be independent of DDR. We have shown that many FA proteins participate in the
      selective autophagy pathway that is required for the destruction of unwanted
      intracellular constituents. In this Cell Science at a Glance and the accompanying
      poster, we briefly review the role of the FA pathway in DDR and recent findings
      that link proteins of the FA pathway to selective autophagy of viruses and
      mitochondria. Finally, we discuss how perturbations in FA protein-mediated
      selective autophagy may contribute to inflammatory as well as genotoxic stress.

TI  - Adenovirus core protein VII down-regulates the DNA damage response on the host
      genome.
LID - JVI.01089-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01089-17 [doi]
AB  - Viral manipulation of cellular proteins allows viruses to suppress host defenses 
      and generate infectious progeny. Due to the linear double-stranded DNA nature of 
      the adenovirus genome, the cellular DNA damage response (DDR) is considered a
      barrier for successful infection. The adenovirus genome is packaged with protein 
      VII, a viral-encoded histone-like core protein that is suggested to protect
      incoming viral genomes from detection by cellular DNA damage machinery. We showed
      that protein VII localizes to host chromatin during infection, leading us to
      hypothesize that protein VII may affect DNA damage responses on the cellular
      genome. Here, we show that protein VII at cellular chromatin results in a
      significant decrease in accumulation of phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX) following
      irradiation, indicating that protein VII inhibits DDR signaling. The oncoprotein 
      SET was recently suggested to modulate the DDR by affecting access of repair
      proteins to chromatin. Since protein VII binds SET, we investigated a role for
      SET in DDR inhibition by protein VII. We show that knockdown of SET partially
      rescues the protein VII-induced decrease in gammaH2AX accumulation on the host
      genome, suggesting that SET is required for inhibition. Finally, we show that
      knockdown of SET also allows ATM to localize to incoming viral genomes bound by
      protein VII during infection with a mutant lacking early region E4. Together, our
      data suggest that the protein VII-SET interaction contributes to DDR evasion by
      adenovirus. Our results provide an additional example of a strategy used by
      adenovirus to manipulate the host DDR and show how viruses can modify cellular
      processes through manipulation of host chromatin.IMPORTANCE The DNA damage
      response (DDR) is a cellular network crucial for maintaining genome integrity.
      DNA viruses replicating in the nucleus challenge the resident genome and must
      overcome cellular responses, including the DDR. Adenoviruses are prevalent human 
      pathogens that can cause a multitude of diseases such as respiratory infections
      and conjunctivitis. Here we describe how a small adenovirus core protein that
      localizes to host chromatin during infection can globally down-regulate the DDR. 
      Our study focuses on key players in the damage signaling pathway and highlights
      how viral manipulation of chromatin may influence access of DDR proteins to the
      host genome.

TI  - The Relationship Between Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms, the Expression of DNA
      Damage Response Genes, and Hepatocellular Carcinoma in a Polish Population.
PG  - 693-708
LID - 10.1089/dna.2017.3664 [doi]
AB  - The molecular mechanism of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is related to DNA
      damage caused by oxidative stress products induced by hepatitis B virus (HBV) or 
      C (HCV) infection and exposure to environmental pollutants. Single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) of DNA damage response (DDR) genes may influence individual 
      susceptibility to environmental risk factors and affect DNA repair efficacy,
      which, in turn, can influence the risk of HCC. The study evaluates a panel of 15 
      SNPs in 11 DDR genes (XRCC1, XRCC3, XPD, MUTYH, LIG1, LIG3, hOGG1, PARP1, NFIL1, 
      FEN1, and APEX1) in 65 HCC patients, 50 HBV- and 50 HCV-infected non-cancerous
      patients, and 50 healthy controls. It also estimates the mRNA expression of nine 
      DDR genes in cancerous and adjacent healthy liver tissues. Two of the
      investigated polymorphisms (rs1052133 and rs13181) were associated with HCC risk.
      For all investigated genes, the level of mRNA was significantly lower in HCC
      cancer tissue than in non-cancerous liver tissue. Seven of the investigated
      polymorphisms were statistically related to gene expression in cancer tissues.
      The disruption of DDR genes may be responsible for hepatocellular transformation 
      in HCV-infected patients.

TI  - A Role for the Host DNA Damage Response in Hepatitis B Virus cccDNA Formation-and
      Beyond?
LID - E125 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v9050125 [doi]
AB  - Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection puts more than 250 million people at a 
      greatly increased risk to develop end-stage liver disease. Like all
      hepadnaviruses, HBV replicates via protein-primed reverse transcription of a
      pregenomic (pg) RNA, yielding an unusually structured, viral polymerase-linked
      relaxed-circular (RC) DNA as genome in infectious particles. Upon infection,
      RC-DNA is converted into nuclear covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA.
      Associating with cellular proteins into an episomal minichromosome, cccDNA acts
      as template for new viral RNAs, ensuring formation of progeny virions. Hence,
      cccDNA represents the viral persistence reservoir that is not directly targeted
      by current anti-HBV therapeutics. Eliminating cccDNA will thus be at the heart of
      a cure for chronic hepatitis B. The low production of HBV cccDNA in most
      experimental models and the associated problems in reliable cccDNA quantitation
      have long hampered a deeper understanding of cccDNA molecular biology. Recent
      advancements including cccDNA-dependent cell culture systems have begun to
      identify select host DNA repair enzymes that HBV usurps for RC-DNA to cccDNA
      conversion. While this list is bound to grow, it may represent just one facet of 
      a broader interaction with the cellular DNA damage response (DDR), a network of
      pathways that sense and repair aberrant DNA structures and in the process
      profoundly affect the cell cycle, up to inducing cell death if repair fails.
      Given the divergent interactions between other viruses and the DDR it will be
      intriguing to see how HBV copes with this multipronged host system.

AB  - Over 110 million units of blood are collected yearly. The need for blood products
      is greater in developing countries, but so is the risk of contracting a
      transfusion-transmitted infection. Without efficient donor screening/viral
      testing and validated pathogen inactivation technology, the risk of
      transfusion-transmitted infections correlates with the infection rate of the
      donor population. The World Health Organization has published guidelines on good 
      manufacturing practices in an effort to ensure a strong global standard of
      transfusion and blood product safety. Sub-Saharan Africa is a high-risk region
      for malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and syphilis. 
      Southeast Asia experiences high rates of hepatitis C virus. Areas with a tropical
      climate have an increased risk of Zika virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus and
      Chikungunya, and impoverished countries face economical limitations which hinder 
      efforts to acquire the most modern pathogen inactivation technology. These
      systems include Mirasol((R)) Pathogen Reduction Technology, INTERCEPT((R)), and
      THERAFLEX((R)). Their procedures use a chemical and ultraviolet or visible light 
      for pathogen inactivation and significantly decrease the threat of pathogen
      transmission in plasma and platelets. They are licensed for use in Europe and are
      used in several other countries. The current interest in the blood industry is
      the development of pathogen inactivation technologies that can treat whole blood 
      (WB) and red blood cell (RBC). The Mirasol system has recently undergone phase
      III clinical trials for treating WB in Ghana and has demonstrated some efficacy
      toward malaria inactivation and low risk of adverse effects. A 2(nd)-generation
      of the INTERCEPT((R)) S-303 system for WB is currently undergoing a phase III
      clinical trial. Both methodologies are applicable for WB and components derived
      from virally reduced WB or RBC.

AB  - Replication of minute virus of mice (MVM) induces a sustained cellular DNA damage
      response (DDR) which the virus then exploits to prepare the nuclear environment
      for effective parvovirus takeover. An essential aspect of the MVM-induced DDR is 
      the establishment of a potent premitotic block, which we previously found to be
      independent of activated p21 and ATR/Chk1 signaling. This arrest, unlike others
      reported previously, depends upon a significant, specific depletion of cyclin B1 
      and its encoding RNA, which precludes cyclin B1/CDK1 complex function, thus
      preventing mitotic entry. We show here that while the stability of cyclin B1 RNA 
      was not affected by MVM infection, the production of nascent cyclin B1 RNA was
      substantially diminished at late times postinfection. Ectopic expression of NS1
      alone did not reduce cyclin B1 expression. MVM infection also reduced the levels 
      of cyclin B1 protein, and RNA levels normally increased in response to
      DNA-damaging reagents. We demonstrated that at times of reduced cyclin B1
      expression during infection, there was a significantly reduced occupancy of RNA
      polymerase II and the essential mitotic transcription factor FoxM1 on the cyclin 
      B1 gene promoter. Additionally, while total FoxM1 levels remained constant, there
      was a significant decrease of the phosphorylated, likely active, forms of FoxM1. 
      Targeting of a constitutively active FoxM1 construct or the activation domain of 
      FoxM1 to the cyclin B1 gene promoter via clustered regularly interspaced short
      palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-enzymatically inactive Cas9 in MVM-infected cells
      increased both cyclin B1 protein and RNA levels, implicating FoxM1 as a critical 
      target for cyclin B1 inhibition during MVM infection.IMPORTANCE Replication of

TI  - Deficiency in DNA damage response, a new characteristic of cells infected with
      latent HIV-1.

AB  - Viruses can interact with host cell molecules responsible for the recognition and
      repair of DNA lesions, resulting in dysfunctional DNA damage response (DDR).
      Cells with inefficient DDR are more vulnerable to therapeutic approaches that
      target DDR, thereby raising DNA damage to a threshold that triggers apoptosis.
      Here, we demonstrate that 2 Jurkat-derived cell lines with incorporated silent
      HIV-1 provirus show increases in DDR signaling that responds to formation of
      double strand DNA breaks (DSBs). We found that phosphorylation of histone H2AX on
      Ser139 (gamma-H2AX), a biomarker of DSBs, and phosphorylation of ATM at Ser1981, 
      Chk2 at Thr68, and p53 at Ser15, part of signaling pathways associated with DSBs,
      are elevated in these cells. These results indicate a DDR defect even though the 
      virus is latent. DDR-inducing agents, specifically high doses of nucleoside RT
      inhibitors (NRTIs), caused greater increases in gamma-H2AX levels in latently
      infected cells. Additionally, latently infected cells are more susceptible to
      long-term exposure to G-quadruplex stabilizing agents, and this effect is
      enhanced when the agent is combined with an inhibitor targeting DNA-PK, which is 
      crucial for DSB repair and telomere maintenance. Moreover, exposing these cells
      to the cancer drug etoposide resulted in formation of DSBs at a higher rate than 
      in un-infected cells. Similar effects of etoposide were also observed in
      population of primary memory T cells infected with latent HIV-1. Sensitivity to
      these agents highlights a unique vulnerability of latently infected cells, a new 
      feature that could potentially be used in developing therapies to eliminate HIV-1
      reservoirs.

TI  - Rad51 Degradation: Role in Oncolytic Virus-Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor 
      Combination Therapy in Glioblastoma.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djw229 [doi]
AB  - Background: Clinical success of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARP i ) 
      has been limited to repair-deficient cancers and by resistance. Oncolytic herpes 
      simplex viruses (oHSVs) selectively kill cancer cells, irrespective of mutation, 
      and manipulate DNA damage responses (DDR). Here, we explore potential synthetic
      lethal-like interactions between oHSV and PARP i . Methods: The efficacy of
      combining PARP i , oHSV MG18L, and G47Delta in killing patient-derived
      glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) was assessed using cell viability assays and
      Chou-Talalay synergy analysis. Effects on DDR pathways, apoptosis, and cell cycle
      after manipulation with pharmacological inhibitors and lentivirus-mediated
      knockdown or overexpression were examined by immunoblotting and FACS. In vivo
      efficacy was evaluated in two GSC-derived orthotopic xenograft models (n = 7-8
      per group). All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: GSCs are
      differentially sensitive to PARP i despite uniform inhibition of PARP activity.
      oHSV sensitized GSCs to PARP i , irrespective of their PARP i sensitivity through
      selective proteasomal degradation of key DDR proteins; Rad51, mediating the
      combination effects; and Chk1. Rad51 degradation required HSV DNA replication.
      This synthetic lethal-like interaction increased DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell 
      death in vitro and in vivo. Combined treatment of mice bearing PARP i -sensitive 
      or -resistant GSC-derived brain tumors greatly extended median survival compared 
      to either agent alone (vs olaparib: P </=.001; vs MG18L: P = .005; median
      survival for sensitive of 83 [95% CI = 77 to 86], 94 [95% CI = 75 to 107], 102
      [95% CI = 85 to 110], and 131 [95% CI = 108 to 170] days and for resistant of 54 
      [95% CI = 52 to 58], 56 [95% CI = 52 to 61], 62 [95% CI = 56 to 72], and 75 [95% 
      CI = 64 to 90] days for mock, PARPi, oHSV, and combination, respectively).
      Conclusions: The unique oHSV property to target multiple components of DDR
      generates cancer selective sensitivity to PARP i . This combination of oHSV with 
      PARP i is a new anticancer strategy that overcomes the clinical barriers of PARP 
      i resistance and DNA repair proficiency and is applicable not only to
      glioblastoma, an invariably lethal tumor, but also to other tumor types.

LID - 10.1631/jzus.B1600306 [doi]
AB  - The DNA damage response (DDR) is activated when DNA is altered by intrinsic or
      extrinsic agents. This pathway is a complex signaling network and plays important
      roles in genome stability, tumor transformation, and cell cycle regulation. Human
      papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the main etiological agents of cervical cancer.
      Cervical cancer ranks as the fourth most common cancer among women and the second
      most frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Over 200 types of HPVs
      have been identified and about one third of these infect the genital tract. The
      HPV life cycle is associated with epithelial differentiation. Recent studies have
      shown that HPVs deregulate the DDR to achieve a productive life cycle. In this
      review, I summarize current findings about how HPVs mediate the
      ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) and the ATM-and RAD3-related kinase
      (ATR) DDRs, and focus on the roles that ATM and ATR signalings play in HPV viral 
      replication. In addition, I demonstrate that the signal transducer and activator 
      of transcription-5 (STAT)-5, an important immune regulator, can promote ATM and
      ATR activations through different mechanisms. These findings may provide novel
      opportunities for development of new therapeutic targets for HPV-related cancers.

TI  - Parvovirus B19 NS1 protein induces cell cycle arrest at G2-phase by activating
      the ATR-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway.
PG  - e1006266
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006266 [doi]
AB  - Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection of primary human erythroid progenitor cells
      (EPCs) arrests infected cells at both late S-phase and G2-phase, which contain 4N
      DNA. B19V infection induces a DNA damage response (DDR) that facilitates viral
      DNA replication but is dispensable for cell cycle arrest at G2-phase; however, a 
      putative C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD2) within NS1 is responsible for
      G2-phase arrest. To fully understand the mechanism underlying B19V NS1-induced
      G2-phase arrest, we established two doxycycline-inducible B19V-permissive
      UT7/Epo-S1 cell lines that express NS1 or NS1mTAD2, and examined the function of 
      the TAD2 domain during G2-phase arrest. The results confirm that the NS1 TAD2
      domain plays a pivotal role in NS1-induced G2-phase arrest. Mechanistically, NS1 
      transactivated cellular gene expression through the TAD2 domain, which was itself
      responsible for ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related) activation. 
      Activated ATR phosphorylated CDC25C at serine 216, which in turn inactivated the 
      cyclin B/CDK1 complex without affecting nuclear import of the complex.
      Importantly, we found that the ATR-CHK1-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway was activated during 
      B19V infection of EPCs, and that ATR activation played an important role in B19V 
      infection-induced G2-phase arrest.

TI  - The DNA damage response promotes polyomavirus JC infection by nucleus to
      cytoplasm NF- kappaB activation.
PG  - 31
LID - 10.1186/s12985-017-0707-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection of glial cells by human neurotropic polyomavirus JC (JCV), 
      the causative agent of the CNS demyelinating disease progressive multifocal
      leukoencephalopathy (PML), rapidly inflicts damage to cellular DNA. This
      activates DNA damage response (DDR) signaling including induction of expression
      of DNA repair factor Rad51. We previously reported that Rad51 co-operates with
      the transcription factor NF-kappaB p65 to activate JCV early transcription. Thus 
      Rad51 induction by JCV infection may provide positive feedback for viral
      activation early in JCV infection. DDR is also known to stimulate NF-kappaB
      activity, a phenomenon known as nucleus to cytoplasm or "inside-out" NF-kappaB
      signaling, which is initiated by Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein, a
      serine/threonine kinase recruited and activated by DNA double-strand breaks.
      Downstream of ATM, there occurs a series of post-translational modifications of
      NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO), the gamma regulatory subunit of inhibitor
      of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) kinase (IKK), resulting in NF-kappaB activation. METHODS: 
      We analyzed the effects of downstream pathways in the DDR by phosphospecific
      Western blots and analysis of the subcellular distribution of NEMO by cell
      fractionation and immunocytochemistry. The role of DDR in JCV infection was
      analyzed using a small molecule inhibitor of ATM (KU-55933). NEMO sumoylation was
      investigated by Western and association of ATM and NEMO by
      immunoprecipitation/Western blots. RESULTS: We show that JCV infection caused
      phosphorylation and activation of ATM while KU-55933 inhibited JCV replication.
      JCV infection caused a redistribution of NEMO from cytoplasm to nucleus.
      Co-expression of JCV large T-antigen and FLAG-tagged NEMO showed the occurrence
      of sumoylation of NEMO, while co-expression of ATM and FLAG-NEMO demonstrated
      physical association between ATM and NEMO. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a model where 
      JCV infection induces both overexpression of Rad51 protein and activation of the 
      nucleus to cytoplasm NF-kappaB signaling pathway, which then act together to
      enhance JCV gene expression.

TI  - Short-term inhibition of TERT induces telomere length-independent cell cycle
      arrest and apoptotic response in EBV-immortalized and transformed B cells.
PG  - e2562
LID - 10.1038/cddis.2016.425 [doi]
AB  - Besides its canonical role in stabilizing telomeres, telomerase reverse
      transcriptase (TERT) may promote tumorigenesis through extra-telomeric functions.
      The possible therapeutic effects of BIBR1532 (BIBR), a powerful TERT inhibitor,
      have been evaluated in different cellular backgrounds, but no data are currently 
      available regarding Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven B-cell malignancies. Our aim 
      was to characterize the biological effects of TERT inhibition by BIBR on
      EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and fully transformed Burkitt's
      lymphoma (BL) cell lines. We found that BIBR selectively inhibits telomerase
      activity in TERT-positive 4134/Late and 4134/TERT+ LCLs and EBV-negative BL41 and
      EBV-positive BL41/B95.8 BL cell lines. TERT inhibition led to decreased cell
      proliferation, accumulation of cells in the S-phase and ultimately to increased
      apoptosis, compared with mock-treated control cells. All these effects occurred
      within 72 h and were not observed in BIBR-treated TERT-negative 4134/TERT- and
      U2OS cells. The cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, consequent upon short-term TERT 
      inhibition, were associated with and likely dependent on the activation of the
      DNA damage response (DDR), highlighted by the increased levels of gammaH2AX and
      activation of ATM and ATR pathways. Analyses of the mean and range of telomere
      lengths and telomere dysfunction-induced foci indicated that DDR after short-term
      TERT inhibition was not related to telomere dysfunction, thus suggesting that
      TERT, besides stabilizing telomere, may protect DNA via telomere-independent
      mechanisms. Notably, TERT-positive LCLs treated with BIBR in combination with
      fludarabine or cyclophosphamide showed a significant increase in the number of
      apoptotic cells with respect to those treated with chemotherapeutic agents alone.
      In conclusion, TERT inhibition impairs cell cycle progression and enhances the
      pro-apoptotic effects of chemotherapeutic agents in TERT-positive cells. These
      results support new therapeutic applications of TERT inhibitors in EBV-driven
      B-cell malignancies.

      tonsillar B-cells.
PG  - 6461-6474
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.14120 [doi]
AB  - Primary infection of the immunocompromised host with the oncovirus Epstein-Barr
      virus (EBV) that targets mainly B-cells is associated with an increased risk for 
      EBV-associated tumors. The early events subsequent to primary infection with
      potential for B-cell transformation are poorly studied. Here, we modeled in vitro
      the primary infection by using B-cells isolated from tonsils, the portal of entry
      of EBV, since species specificity of EBV hampers modeling in experimental
      animals. Increasing evidence indicates that the host DNA damage response (DDR)
      can influence and be influenced by EBV infection. Thus, we inoculated tonsillar
      B-cells (TBCs) with EBV-B95.8 and investigated cell proliferation and the DDR
      during the first 96 hours thereafter. We identified for the first time that EBV
      infection of TBCs induces a period of hyperproliferation 48-96 hours post
      infection characterized by the activation of ataxia telangiectasia and
      Rad3-releated (ATR) and checkpoint kinase-1 (Chk1). Whereas inhibition of Chk1
      did not affect B-cell transformation, the specific inhibition of ATR robustly
      decreased the transformation efficiency of EBV. Our results suggest that
      activation of ATR is key for EBV-induced B-cell transformation. Thus, targeting
      the interaction between ATR/Chk1 and EBV could offer new options for the
      treatment of EBV-associated malignancies.

AB  - We sought to explore the fate of the fatty acid synthesis pathway in human
      fibroblasts exposed to DNA damaging agents capable of inducing senescence, a
      state of irreversible growth arrest. Induction of premature senescence by
      doxorubicin or hydrogen peroxide led to a decrease in protein and mRNA levels of 
      acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step
      in fatty-acid biosynthesis. ACC1 decay accompanied the activation of the DNA
      damage response (DDR), and resulted in decreased lipid synthesis. A reduction in 
      protein and mRNA levels of ACC1 and in lipid synthesis was also observed in human
      primary fibroblasts that underwent replicative senescence. We also explored the
      consequences of inhibiting fatty acid synthesis in proliferating non-transformed 
      cells. Using shRNA technology, we knocked down ACC1 in human fibroblasts.
      Interestingly, this metabolic perturbation was sufficient to arrest proliferation
      and trigger the appearance of several markers of the DDR and increase senescence 
      associated beta-galactosidase activity. Reactive oxygen species and p38 mitogen
      activated protein kinase phosphorylation participated in the induction of
      senescence. Similar results were obtained upon silencing of fatty acid synthase
      (FAS) expression. Together our results point towards a tight coordination of
      fatty acid synthesis and cell proliferation in human fibroblasts.

      Facilitates Viral Replication and Mediates Apoptotic Responses.
PG  - 39444

AB  - Cellular DNA damage response (DDR) triggered by infection of DNA viruses mediate 
      cell cycle checkpoint activation, DNA repair, or apoptosis induction. In the
      present study, infection of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), which serves as a
      major etiological agent of PCV2-associated diseases (PCVAD), was found to elicit 
      a DNA damage response (DDR) as observed by the phosphorylation of H2AX and RPA32 
      following infection. The response requires active viral replication, and all the 
      ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase), ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related kinase),
      and DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase) are the transducers of the DDR
      signaling events in the PCV2-infected cells as demonstrated by the
      phosphorylation of ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK signalings as well as reductions in their
      activations after treatment with specific kinase inhibitors. Inhibitions of ATM, 
      ATR, and DNA-PK activations block viral replication and prevent apoptotic
      responses as observed by decreases in cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)
      and caspase-3 as well as fragmented DNA following PCV2 infection. These results
      reveal that PCV2 is able to exploit the cellular DNA damage response machinery
      for its own efficient replication and for apoptosis induction, further extending 
      our understanding for the molecular mechanism of PCV2 infection.

TI  - Transcriptomic Analysis Implicates the p53 Signaling Pathway in the Establishment
      of HIV-1 Latency in Central Memory CD4 T Cells in an In Vitro Model.
PG  - e1006026
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006026 [doi]
AB  - The search for an HIV-1 cure has been greatly hindered by the presence of a viral
      reservoir that persists despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Studies of HIV-1
      latency in vivo are also complicated by the low proportion of latently infected
      cells in HIV-1 infected individuals. A number of models of HIV-1 latency have
      been developed to examine the signaling pathways and viral determinants of
      latency and reactivation. A primary cell model of HIV-1 latency, which
      incorporates the generation of primary central memory CD4 T cells (TCM),
      full-length virus infection (HIVNL4-3) and ART to suppress virus replication, was
      used to investigate the establishment of HIV latency using RNA-Seq. Initially, an
      investigation of host and viral gene expression in the resting and activated
      states of this model indicated that the resting condition was reflective of a
      latent state. Then, a comparison of the host transcriptome between the uninfected
      and latently infected conditions of this model identified 826 differentially
      expressed genes, many of which were related to p53 signaling. Inhibition of the
      transcriptional activity of p53 by pifithrin-alpha during HIV-1 infection reduced
      the ability of HIV-1 to be reactivated from its latent state by an unknown
      mechanism. In conclusion, this model may be used to screen latency reversing
      agents utilized in shock and kill approaches to cure HIV, to search for cellular 
      markers of latency, and to understand the mechanisms by which HIV-1 establishes
      latency.

TI  - KSHV Entry and Trafficking in Target Cells-Hijacking of Cell Signal Pathways,
      Actin and Membrane Dynamics.
LID - E305 [pii]
AB  - Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is etiologically associated with
      human endothelial cell hyperplastic Kaposi's sarcoma and B-cell primary effusion 
      lymphoma. KSHV infection of adherent endothelial and fibroblast cells are used as
      in vitro models for infection and KSHV enters these cells by host membrane bleb
      and actin mediated macropinocytosis or clathrin endocytosis pathways,
      respectively. Infection in endothelial and fibroblast cells is initiated by the
      interactions between multiple viral envelope glycoproteins and cell surface
      associated heparan sulfate (HS), integrins (alpha3beta1, alphaVbeta3 and
      alphaVbeta5), and EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase (EphA2R). This review summarizes
      the accumulated studies demonstrating that KSHV manipulates the host signal
      pathways to enter and traffic in the cytoplasm of the target cells, to deliver
      the viral genome into the nucleus, and initiate viral gene expression. KSHV
      interactions with the cell surface receptors is the key platform for the
      manipulations of host signal pathways which results in the simultaneous induction
      of FAK, Src, PI3-K, Rho-GTPase, ROS, Dia-2, PKC zeta, c-Cbl, CIB1, Crk, p130Cas
      and GEF-C3G signal and adaptor molecules that play critical roles in the
      modulation of membrane and actin dynamics, and in the various steps of the early 
      stages of infection such as entry and trafficking towards the nucleus. The
      Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) proteins are also
      recruited to assist in viral entry and trafficking. In addition, KSHV
      interactions with the cell surface receptors also induces the host transcription 
      factors NF-kappaB, ERK1/2, and Nrf2 early during infection to initiate and
      modulate viral and host gene expression. Nuclear delivery of the viral dsDNA
      genome is immediately followed by the host innate responses such as the DNA
      damage response (DDR), inflammasome and interferon responses. Overall, these
      studies form the initial framework for further studies of simultaneous targeting 
      of KSHV glycoproteins, host receptor, signal molecules and trafficking machinery 
      that would lead into novel therapeutic methods to prevent KSHV infection of
      target cells and consequently the associated malignancies.

AB  - Following the discovery of HEV in the 1980s, it became apparent that HEV is
      endemic in a number of developing countries in Asia, Africa and Mexico. In these 
      geographical settings HEV is spread oral faecally by HEV genotypes (gt) 1 and 2, 
      which are obligate human pathogens. Infection occurs oro-faecally, often as a
      result in the breakdown of fragile sanitary infrastructure allowing drinking
      water supplies to become contaminated with human sewage. Hepatitis E usually
      causes a self-limiting hepatitis in young adults with sporadic cases and
      occasional dramatic outbreaks involving hundreds or thousands of cases.
      Clinically the illness is indistinguishable from hepatitis A, except in pregnant 
      women where the mortality is 20-25%. Death occurs in the third trimester from
      fulminant hepatic failure and obstetric complications such as eclampsia, with
      very high associated foetal loss. For the best part of 20 years hepatitis E was
      considered as an imported disease in developed countries, and was only seen in
      travellers returning from endemic developing countries. We got this very badly
      wrong: HEV gt3 was 'hiding in the shadows' in humans, pigs, and other animals.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted viral
      infection. Infection with certain types of HPV pose a major public health risk as
      these types are associated with multiple human cancers, including cervical
      cancer, other anogenital malignancies and an increasing number of head and neck
      cancers. The HPV life cycle is closely tied to host cell differentiation with
      late viral events such as structural gene expression and viral genome
      amplification taking place in the upper layers of the stratified epithelium. The 
      DNA damage response (DDR) is an elaborate signaling network of proteins that
      regulate the fidelity of replication by detecting, signaling and repairing DNA
      lesions. ATM and ATR are two kinases that are major regulators of DNA damage
      detection and repair. A multitude of studies indicate that activation of the ATM 
      (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related) 
      pathways are critical for HPV to productively replicate. This review outlines how
      HPV interfaces with the ATM- and ATR-dependent DNA damage responses throughout
      the viral life cycle to create an environment supportive of viral replication and
      how activation of these pathways could impact genomic stability.

PG  - 69-78
AB  - Expressing oncogenes in normal somatic human cells leads to cellular senescence
      after just a few cell division cycles. In cells that are more resistant to
      culture stresses, such as human dermal fibroblasts, this oncogene-induced
      senescence (OIS) is a result of a DNA damage response (DDR) that is activated due
      to the formation of DNA lesions at both non-telomeric and telomeric DNA
      sequences. DNA lesions can be visualized as DDR foci by immunofluorescence
      microscopy using antibodies against a number of DDR factors, including
      Upsilon-H2AX and 53BP1. Over time and as cells remain arrested in OIS,
      non-telomeric DDR foci progressively become resolved, while telomeric DDR foci,
      also called dysfunctional telomeres, persist. Here we describe a protocol to
      detect dysfunctional telomeres in cultured human cells, to monitor a temporal
      enrichment of dysfunctional telomeres in cells that had undergone OIS, and to
      detect dysfunctional telomeres in paraffin-embedded and formalin-fixed human
      tissue.

TI  - DNA Damage Signaling Is Required for Replication of Human Bocavirus 1 DNA in
      Dividing HEK293 Cells.
LID - e01831-16 [pii]
AB  - Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), an emerging human-pathogenic respiratory virus, is a
      member of the genus Bocaparvovirus of the Parvoviridae family. In human airway
      epithelium air-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) cultures, HBoV1 infection initiates a
      DNA damage response (DDR), activating all three phosphatidylinositol
      3-kinase-related kinases (PI3KKs): ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs. In this context,
      activation of PI3KKs is a requirement for amplification of the HBoV1 genome (X.
      Deng, Z. Yan, F. Cheng, J. F. Engelhardt, and J. Qiu, PLoS Pathog, 12:e1005399,
      2016, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005399), and HBoV1 replicates only in
      terminally differentiated, nondividing cells. This report builds on the previous 
      discovery that the replication of HBoV1 DNA can also occur in dividing HEK293
      cells, demonstrating that such replication is likewise dependent on a DDR.
      Transfection of HEK293 cells with the duplex DNA genome of HBoV1 induces
      hallmarks of DDR, including phosphorylation of H2AX and RPA32, as well as
      activation of all three PI3KKs. The large viral nonstructural protein NS1 is
      sufficient to induce the DDR and the activation of the three PI3KKs.
      Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of any one of the PI3KKs significantly
      decreases both the replication of HBoV1 DNA and the downstream production of
      progeny virions. The DDR induced by the HBoV1 NS1 protein does not cause obvious 
      damage to cellular DNA or arrest of the cell cycle. Notably, key DNA replication 
      factors and major DNA repair DNA polymerases (polymerase eta [Pol eta] and
      polymerase kappa [Pol kappa]) are recruited to the viral DNA replication centers 
      and facilitate HBoV1 DNA replication. Our study provides the first evidence of
      the DDR-dependent parvovirus DNA replication that occurs in dividing cells and is
      independent of cell cycle arrest. IMPORTANCE: The parvovirus human bocavirus 1
      (HBoV1) is an emerging respiratory virus that causes lower respiratory tract
      infections in young children worldwide. HEK293 cells are the only dividing cells 
      tested that fully support the replication of the duplex genome of this virus and 
      allow the production of progeny virions. In this study, we demonstrate that HBoV1
      induces a DDR that plays significant roles in the replication of the viral DNA
      and the production of progeny virions in HEK293 cells. We also show that both
      cellular DNA replication factors and DNA repair DNA polymerases colocalize within
      centers of viral DNA replication and that Pol eta and Pol kappa play an important
      role in HBoV1 DNA replication. Whereas the DDR that leads to the replication of
      the DNA of other parvoviruses is facilitated by the cell cycle, the DDR triggered
      by HBoV1 DNA replication or NS1 is not. HBoV1 is the first parvovirus whose NS1
      has been shown to be able to activate all three PI3KKs (ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs).

AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPV) exhibit constitutive activation of ATM and ATR DNA
      damage response (DDR) pathways, which are required for productive viral
      replication. Expression of HPV31 E7 alone is sufficient to activate the DDR
      through an unknown mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that the E7 Rb binding domain 
      is required to increase levels of many DDR proteins, including ATM, Chk2, Chk1,
      the MRN components MRE11, Rad50, and NBS1, as well as the homologous
      recombination repair proteins BRCA1 and Rad51. Interestingly, we have found that 
      the increase in these DNA repair proteins does not occur solely at the level of
      transcription, but that E7 broadly increases the half-life of these DDR factors, 
      a phenotype that is lost in the E7 Rb binding mutant. These data suggest that
      HPV-31 upregulates DNA repair factors necessary for replication by increasing
      protein half-life in a manner requiring the E7 Rb binding domain.

TI  - Pim2 is important for regulating DNA damage response in multiple myeloma cells.
PG  - e462
LID - 10.1038/bcj.2016.73 [doi]
AB  - Pan proviral integrations of Moloney virus (PIM) inhibition in multiple myeloma
      (MM) results in reduced cell viability in tested human-derived MM cell lines and 
      reduces tumor burden in xenograft mouse models, making PIMs important therapeutic
      targets for the disease. PIM kinase inhibitors are currently being tested
      clinically in MM. We sought to elucidate the role of the various PIMs in MM. Our 
      data demonstrate that Pim2 has a significant role in MM cell cytotoxicity. Our
      data provide evidence for a novel role for Pim2 in the regulation of the DNA
      damage response (DDR). Knockdown of Pim2 upregulates several downstream DDR
      markers, mimicking the effects of doxorubicin (Dox) treatment of MM cells, and
      suggesting a role for the kinase as a negative regulator of this pathway.
      Dox-induced DNA damage results in a decrease in Pim2 levels, placing the kinase
      directly downstream of the site of Dox-DNA binding. Overexpression of Pim2
      confers a slight survival advantage against Dox through antiapoptotic activity,
      further underscoring its relevance in the DDR pathway. These data provide
      insights into a novel mechanism of PIM kinase activity and provide the framework 
      for designing therapeutic approaches in MM.

AB  - Nuclear replication of DNA viruses activates DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways,
      which are thought to detect and inhibit viral replication. However, many DNA
      viruses also depend on these pathways in order to optimally replicate their
      genomes. We investigated the relationship between murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) and
      components of DDR signaling pathways including CHK1, CHK2, H2AX, ATR, and DNAPK. 
      We found that recruitment and retention of DDR proteins at viral replication
      centers was independent of H2AX, as well as the viral small and middle
      T-antigens. Additionally, infectious virus production required ATR kinase
      activity, but was independent of CHK1, CHK2, or DNAPK signaling. ATR inhibition
      did not reduce the total amount of viral DNA accumulated, but affected the amount
      of virus produced, indicating a defect in virus assembly. These results suggest
      that MuPyV may utilize a subset of DDR proteins or non-canonical DDR signaling
      pathways in order to efficiently replicate and assemble.

TI  - A Central Role for STAT3 in Gammaherpesvirus-Life Cycle and -Diseases.
PG  - 1052
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2016.01052 [doi]
AB  - Having co-evolved with humans, herpesviruses have adapted to exploit the host
      molecular machinery to ensure viral persistence. The cellular protein Signal
      Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is a leading example. STAT3
      is a prominent transcription factor that functions in a variety of physiologic
      processes including embryonic development, inflammation, immunity, and wound
      healing. Generally activated via growth factor and cytokine signaling, STAT3 can 
      transcriptionally drive oncoproteins, pro-survival and pro-proliferative proteins
      as well as angiogenic factors, thereby contributing to cancer. As in most
      non-viral cancers, STAT3 is constitutively active in EBV-related B and epithelial
      cell cancers and in animal models of KSHV-cancers. Again, similar to non-viral
      cancers, STAT3 contributes to gammaherpesvirus (EBV and KSHV)-mediated cancers by
      driving cell proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis. Being herpesviruses, EBV
      and KSHV establish latency in humans with episodic lytic activation. Importantly,
      both viruses activate STAT3 almost immediately upon infection of primary cells.
      In the setting of infection of primary B cells by EBV, this rapidly activated
      STAT3 plays a key role in suppressing the DNA damage response (DDR) to
      EBV-oncogene triggered replication stress, thereby facilitating B cell
      proliferation and ultimately establishment of latency. STAT3 also contributes to 
      maintenance of latency by curbing lytic activation of EBV and KSHV in latent
      cells that express high levels of STAT3. In this way, gammaherpesviruses exploit 
      STAT3 to overcome cellular anti-proliferative and anti-lytic barriers to promote 
      viral persistence. These investigations into gammaherpesviruses and STAT3 have
      simultaneously revealed a novel function for STAT3 in suppression of the DDR, a
      process fundamental to physiologic cell proliferation as well as development of
      cancer.

TI  - TRIP12 as a mediator of human papillomavirus/p16-related radiation enhancement
      effects.
PG  - 820-828
LID - 10.1038/onc.2016.250 [doi]
AB  - Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (HNSCC) have better responses to radiotherapy and higher overall
      survival rates than do patients with HPV-negative HNSCC, but the mechanisms
      underlying this phenomenon are unknown. p16 is used as a surrogate marker for HPV
      infection. Our goal was to examine the role of p16 in HPV-related favorable
      treatment outcomes and to investigate the mechanisms by which p16 may regulate
      radiosensitivity. HNSCC cells and xenografts (HPV/p16-positive and -negative)
      were used. p16-overexpressing and small hairpin RNA-knockdown cells were
      generated, and the effect of p16 on radiosensitivity was determined by clonogenic
      cell survival and tumor growth delay assays. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were
      assessed by immunofluorescence analysis of 53BP1 foci; DSB levels were determined
      by neutral comet assay; western blotting was used to evaluate protein changes;
      changes in protein half-life were tested with a cycloheximide assay; gene
      expression was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction; and data from The
      Cancer Genome Atlas HNSCC project were analyzed. p16 overexpression led to
      downregulation of TRIP12, which in turn led to increased RNF168 levels, repressed
      DNA damage repair (DDR), increased 53BP1 foci and enhanced radioresponsiveness.
      Inhibition of TRIP12 expression further led to radiosensitization, and
      overexpression of TRIP12 was associated with poor survival in patients with
      HPV-positive HNSCC. These findings reveal that p16 participates in
      radiosensitization through influencing DDR and support the rationale of blocking 
      TRIP12 to improve radiotherapy outcomes.

AB  - It is unknown whether DNA damage accumulation is an upstream instigator or
      secondary effect of the cell death process in different populations of adult
      postmitotic neurons in the central nervous system. In two different mouse models 
      of injury-induced neurodegeneration characterized by relatively synchronous
      accumulation of mitochondria, oxidative stress, and DNA damage prior to neuronal 
      apoptosis, we enforced the expression of human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase
      (hOGG1) and human apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease-1/Ref1 (hAPE) using
      recombinant adenoviruses (Ad). Thalamic lateral geniculate neurons and lumbar
      spinal cord motor neurons were transduced by Ad-hOGG1 and Ad-hAPE injections into
      the occipital cortex and skeletal muscle, respectively, prior to their target
      deprivation- and axotomy-induced retrograde apoptosis. Enforced expression of
      hOGG1 and hAPE in thalamus and spinal cord was confirmed by western blotting and 
      immunohistochemistry. In injured populations of neurons in thalamus and spinal
      cord, a DNA damage response (DDR) was registered, as shown by localization of
      phospho-activated p53, Rad17, and replication protein A-32 immunoreactivities,
      and this DDR was attenuated more effectively by enforced hAPE expression than by 
      hOGG1 expression. Enforced expression of hOGG1 and hAPE significantly protected
      thalamic neurons and motor neurons from retrograde apoptosis induced by target
      deprivation and axotomy. We conclude that a DDR response is engaged
      pre-apoptotically in different types of injured mature CNS neurons and that DNA
      repair enzymes can regulate the survival of retrogradely dying neurons,
      suggesting that DNA damage and activation of DDR are upstream mechanisms for this
      form of adult neurodegeneration in vivo, thus identifying DNA repair as a
      therapeutic target for neuroprotection.

TI  - DNA Damage Reduces the Quality, but Not the Quantity of Human Papillomavirus 16
      E1 and E2 DNA Replication.
LID - 10.3390/v8060175 [doi]
LID - E175 [pii]
AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are causative agents in almost all cervical
      carcinomas. HPVs are also causative agents in head and neck cancer, the cases of 
      which are increasing rapidly. Viral replication activates the DNA damage response
      (DDR) pathway; associated proteins are recruited to replication foci, and this
      pathway may serve to allow for viral genome amplification. Likewise, HPV genome
      double-strand breaks (DSBs) could be produced during replication and could lead
      to linearization and viral integration. Many studies have shown that viral
      integration into the host genome results in unregulated expression of the viral
      oncogenes, E6 and E7, promoting HPV-induced carcinogenesis. Previously, we have
      demonstrated that DNA-damaging agents, such as etoposide, or knocking down viral 
      replication partner proteins, such as topoisomerase II beta binding protein I
      (TopBP1), does not reduce the level of DNA replication. Here, we investigated
      whether these treatments alter the quality of DNA replication by HPV16 E1 and E2.
      We confirm that knockdown of TopBP1 or treatment with etoposide does not reduce
      total levels of E1/E2-mediated DNA replication; however, the quality of
      replication is significantly reduced. The results demonstrate that E1 and E2
      continue to replicate under genomically-stressed conditions and that this
      replication is mutagenic. This mutagenesis would promote the formation of
      substrates for integration of the viral genome into that of the host, a hallmark 
      of cervical cancer.

TI  - Topoisomerase II Inhibitors Can Enhance Baculovirus-Mediated Gene Expression in
      Mammalian Cells through the DNA Damage Response.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17060931 [doi]
LID - E931 [pii]
AB  - BacMam is an insect-derived recombinant baculovirus that can deliver genes into
      mammalian cells. BacMam vectors carrying target genes are able to enter a variety
      of cell lines by endocytosis, but the level of expression of the transgene
      depends on the cell line and the state of the transduced cells. In this study, we
      demonstrated that the DNA damage response (DDR) could act as an alternative
      pathway to boost the transgene(s) expression by BacMam and be comparable to the
      inhibitors of histone deacetylase. Topoisomerase II (Top II) inhibitor-induced
      DDR can enhance the CMV-IE/enhancer mediated gene expression up to 12-fold in
      BacMam-transduced U-2OS cells. The combination of a Top II inhibitor, VM-26, can 
      also augment the killing efficiency of a p53-expressing BacMam vector in U-2OS
      osteosarcoma cells. These results open a new avenue to facilitate the application
      of BacMam for gene delivery and therapy.

TI  - Activation of DNA Damage Response Induced by the Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated
      Herpes Virus.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17060854 [doi]
LID - E854 [pii]
AB  - The human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes 
      virus (KSHV), can infect endothelial cells often leading to cell transformation
      and to the development of tumors, namely Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion 
      lymphoma (PEL), and the plasmablastic variant of multicentric Castleman's
      disease. KSHV is prevalent in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa and the
      Mediterranean region presenting distinct genotypes, which appear to be associated
      with differences in disease manifestation, according to geographical areas. In
      infected cells, KSHV persists in a latent episomal form. However, in a limited
      number of cells, it undergoes spontaneous lytic reactivation to ensure the
      production of new virions. During both the latent and the lytic cycle, KSHV is
      programmed to express genes which selectively modulate the DNA damage response
      (DDR) through the activation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) pathway
      and by phosphorylating factors associated with the DDR, including the major tumor
      suppressor protein p53 tumor suppressor p53. This review will focus on the
      interplay between the KSHV and the DDR response pathway throughout the viral
      lifecycle, exploring the putative molecular mechanism/s that may contribute to
      malignant transformation of host cells.

      promote radioresistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

AB  - We conducted this research to explore the role of latent membrane protein 1
      (LMP1) encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in modulating the DNA damage
      response (DDR) and its regulatory mechanisms in radioresistance. Our results
      revealed that LMP1 repressed the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by
      inhibiting DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) phosphorylation and activity.
      Moreover, LMP1 reduced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
      and changed its subcellular location after irradiation, which appeared to occur
      through a disruption of the physical interaction between AMPK and DNA-PK. The
      decrease in AMPK activity was associated with LMP1-mediated glycolysis and
      resistance to apoptosis induced by irradiation. The reactivation of AMPK
      significantly promoted radiosensitivity both in vivo and in vitro. The AMPKalpha 
      (Thr172) reduction was associated with a poorer clinical outcome of radiation
      therapy in NPC patients. Our data revealed a new mechanism of LMP1-mediated
      radioresistance and provided a mechanistic rationale in support of the use of
      AMPK activators for facilitating NPC radiotherapy.

TI  - The Adenovirus E4orf4 Protein Provides a Novel Mechanism for Inhibition of the
      DNA Damage Response.
PG  - e1005420
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005420 [doi]
AB  - The DNA damage response (DDR) is a conglomerate of pathways designed to detect
      DNA damage and signal its presence to cell cycle checkpoints and to the repair
      machinery, allowing the cell to pause and mend the damage, or if the damage is
      too severe, to trigger apoptosis or senescence. Various DDR branches are
      regulated by kinases of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein kinase
      family, including ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM- and Rad3-related
      (ATR). Replication intermediates and linear double-stranded genomes of DNA
      viruses are perceived by the cell as DNA damage and activate the DDR. If allowed 
      to operate, the DDR will stimulate ligation of viral genomes and will inhibit
      virus replication. To prevent this outcome, many DNA viruses evolved ways to
      limit the DDR. As part of its attack on the DDR, adenovirus utilizes various
      viral proteins to cause degradation of DDR proteins and to sequester the MRN
      damage sensor outside virus replication centers. Here we show that adenovirus
      evolved yet another novel mechanism to inhibit the DDR. The E4orf4 protein,
      together with its cellular partner PP2A, reduces phosphorylation of ATM and ATR
      substrates in virus-infected cells and in cells treated with DNA damaging drugs, 
      and causes accumulation of damaged DNA in the drug-treated cells. ATM and ATR are
      not mutually required for inhibition of their signaling pathways by E4orf4. ATM
      and ATR deficiency as well as E4orf4 expression enhance infection efficiency.
      Furthermore, E4orf4, previously reported to induce cancer-specific cell death
      when expressed alone, sensitizes cells to killing by sub-lethal concentrations of
      DNA damaging drugs, likely because it inhibits DNA damage repair. These findings 
      provide one explanation for the cancer-specificity of E4orf4-induced cell death
      as many cancers have DDR deficiencies leading to increased reliance on the
      remaining intact DDR pathways and to enhanced susceptibility to DDR inhibitors
      such as E4orf4. Thus DDR inhibition by E4orf4 contributes both to the efficiency 
      of adenovirus replication and to the ability of E4orf4 to kill cancer cells.

AB  - The ubiquitin ligase RNF8 promotes the DNA damage response (DDR). We observed
      that the expression of RNF8 was increased in bladder cancer cells and that this
      change in RNF8 expression could be reversed by adenovirus-mediated shRNA
      treatment. Moreover, we found that RNF8 knockdown sensitized bladder cancer cells
      to radiotherapy, as demonstrated by reduced cell survival. Additionally, the
      absence of RNF8 induced a high rate of apoptosis and impaired double-strand break
      repair signaling after radiotherapy. Furthermore, experiments on nude mice showed
      that combining shRNF8 treatment with radiotherapy suppressed implanted bladder
      tumor growth and enhanced apoptotic cell death in vivo. Altogether, our results
      indicated that RNF8 might be a novel target for bladder cancer treatment.

TI  - Replication of an Autonomous Human Parvovirus in Non-dividing Human Airway
      Epithelium Is Facilitated through the DNA Damage and Repair Pathways.
PG  - e1005399
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005399 [doi]
AB  - Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) belongs to the genus Bocaparvovirus of the Parvoviridae
      family, and is an emerging human pathogenic respiratory virus. In vitro, HBoV1
      infects well-differentiated/polarized primary human airway epithelium (HAE)
      cultured at an air-liquid interface (HAE-ALI). Although it is well known that
      autonomous parvovirus replication depends on the S phase of the host cells, we
      demonstrate here that the HBoV1 genome amplifies efficiently in mitotically
      quiescent airway epithelial cells of HAE-ALI cultures. Analysis of HBoV1 DNA in
      infected HAE-ALI revealed that HBoV1 amplifies its ssDNA genome following a
      typical parvovirus rolling-hairpin DNA replication mechanism. Notably, HBoV1
      infection of HAE-ALI initiates a DNA damage response (DDR) with activation of all
      three phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PI3KKs). We found that the
      activation of the three PI3KKs is required for HBoV1 genome amplification; and,
      more importantly, we identified that two Y-family DNA polymerases, Pol eta and
      Pol kappa, are involved in HBoV1 genome amplification. Overall, we have provided 
      an example of de novo DNA synthesis (genome amplification) of an autonomous
      parvovirus in non-dividing cells, which is dependent on the cellular DNA damage
      and repair pathways.

AB  - RNA viruses are a genetically diverse group of pathogens that are responsible for
      some of the most prevalent and lethal human diseases. Numerous viruses introduce 
      DNA damage and genetic instability in host cells during their lifecycles and some
      species also manipulate components of the DNA damage response (DDR), a complex
      and sophisticated series of cellular pathways that have evolved to detect and
      repair DNA lesions. Activation and manipulation of the DDR by DNA viruses has
      been extensively studied. It is apparent, however, that many RNA viruses can also
      induce significant DNA damage, even in cases where viral replication takes place 
      exclusively in the cytoplasm. DNA damage can contribute to the pathogenesis of
      RNA viruses through the triggering of apoptosis, stimulation of inflammatory
      immune responses and the introduction of deleterious mutations that can increase 
      the risk of tumorigenesis. In addition, activation of DDR pathways can contribute
      positively to replication of viral RNA genomes. Elucidation of the interactions
      between RNA viruses and the DDR has provided important insights into modulation
      of host cell functions by these pathogens. This review summarises the current
      literature regarding activation and manipulation of the DDR by several medically 
      important RNA viruses.

AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is etiologically linked to infectious mononucleosis and 
      several human cancers. EBV encodes a conserved protein kinase BGLF4 that plays a 
      key role in the viral life cycle. To provide new insight into the host proteins
      regulated by BGLF4, we utilized stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell
      culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics to compare site-specific
      phosphorylation in BGLF4-expressing Akata B cells. Our analysis revealed
      BGLF4-mediated hyperphosphorylation of 3,046 unique sites corresponding to 1,328 
      proteins. Frequency analysis of these phosphosites revealed a proline-rich motif 
      signature downstream of BGLF4, indicating a broader substrate recognition for
      BGLF4 than its cellular ortholog cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). Further, motif
      analysis of the hyperphosphorylated sites revealed enrichment in ATM, ATR and
      Aurora kinase substrates while functional analyses revealed significant
      enrichment of pathways related to the DNA damage response (DDR), mitosis and cell
      cycle. Phosphorylation of proteins associated with the mitotic spindle assembly
      checkpoint (SAC) indicated checkpoint activation, an event that inactivates the
      anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome, APC/C. Furthermore, we demonstrated that
      BGLF4 binds to and directly phosphorylates the key cellular proteins PP1, MPS1
      and CDC20 that lie upstream of SAC activation and APC/C inhibition. Consistent
      with APC/C inactivation, we found that BGLF4 stabilizes the expression of many
      known APC/C substrates. We also noted hyperphosphorylation of 22 proteins
      associated the nuclear pore complex, which may contribute to nuclear pore
      disassembly and SAC activation. A drug that inhibits mitotic checkpoint
      activation also suppressed the accumulation of extracellular EBV virus. Taken
      together, our data reveal that, in addition to the DDR, manipulation of mitotic
      kinase signaling and SAC activation are mechanisms associated with lytic EBV
      replication. All MS data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with
      identifier PXD002411

TI  - Homologous Recombination Repair Factors Rad51 and BRCA1 Are Necessary for
      Productive Replication of Human Papillomavirus 31.
PG  - 2639-52
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02495-15 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: High-risk human papillomavirus 31 (HPV31)-positive cells exhibit
      constitutive activation of the ATM-dependent DNA damage response (DDR), which is 
      necessary for productive viral replication. In response to DNA double-strand
      breaks (DSBs), ATM activation leads to DNA repair through homologous
      recombination (HR), which requires the principal recombinase protein Rad51, as
      well as BRCA1. Previous studies from our lab demonstrated that Rad51 and BRCA1
      are expressed at high levels in HPV31-positive cells and localize to sites of
      viral replication. These results suggest that HPV may utilize ATM activity to
      increase HR activity as a means to facilitate viral replication. In this study,
      we demonstrate that high-risk HPV E7 expression alone is sufficient for the
      increase in Rad51 and BRCA1 protein levels. We have found that this increase
      occurs, at least in part, at the level of transcription. Studies analyzing
      protein stability indicate that HPV may also protect Rad51 and BRCA1 from
      turnover, contributing to the overall increase in cellular levels. We also
      demonstrate that Rad51 is bound to HPV31 genomes, with binding increasing per
      viral genome upon productive replication. We have found that depletion of Rad51
      and BRCA1, as well as inhibition of Rad51's recombinase activity, abrogates
      productive viral replication upon differentiation. Overall, these results
      indicate that Rad51 and BRCA1 are required for the process of HPV31 genome
      amplification and suggest that productive replication occurs in a manner
      dependent upon recombination. IMPORTANCE: Productive replication of HPV31
      requires activation of an ATM-dependent DNA damage response, though how ATM
      activity contributes to replication is unclear. Rad51 and BRCA1 play essential
      roles in repair of double-strand breaks, as well as the restart of stalled
      replication forks through homologous recombination (HR). Given that ATM activity 
      is required to initiate HR repair, coupled with the requirement of Rad51 and
      BRCA1 for productive viral replication, our findings suggest that HPV may utilize
      ATM activity to ensure localization of recombination factors to productively
      replicating viral genomes. The finding that E7 increases the levels of Rad51 and 
      BRCA1 suggests that E7 contributes to productive replication by providing DNA
      repair factors required for viral DNA synthesis. Our studies not only imply a
      role for recombination in the regulation of productive HPV replication but
      provide further insight into how HPV manipulates the DDR to facilitate the
      productive phase of the viral life cycle.

TI  - Murine Gammaherpesvirus 68 LANA and SOX Homologs Counteract ATM-Driven p53
      Activity during Lytic Viral Replication.
PG  - 2571-85
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02867-15 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Tumor suppressor p53 is activated in response to numerous cellular
      stresses, including viral infection. However, whether murine gammaherpesvirus 68 
      (MHV68) provokes p53 during the lytic replication cycle has not been extensively 
      evaluated. Here, we demonstrate that MHV68 lytic infection induces p53
      phosphorylation and stabilization in a manner that is dependent on the DNA damage
      response (DDR) kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). The induction of p53
      during MHV68 infection occurred in multiple cell types, including splenocytes of 
      infected mice. ATM and p53 activation required early viral gene expression but
      occurred independently of viral DNA replication. At early time points during
      infection, p53-responsive cellular genes were induced, coinciding with p53
      stabilization and phosphorylation. However, p53-related gene expression subsided 
      as infection progressed, even though p53 remained stable and phosphorylated.
      Infected cells also failed to initiate p53-dependent gene expression and undergo 
      apoptosis in response to treatment with exogenous p53 agonists. The inhibition of
      p53 responses during infection required the expression of the MHV68 homologs of
      the shutoff and exonuclease protein (muSOX) and latency-associated nuclear
      antigen (mLANA). Interestingly, mLANA, but not muSOX, was necessary to prevent
      p53-mediated death in MHV68-infected cells under the conditions tested. This
      suggests that muSOX and mLANA are differentially required for inhibiting p53 in
      specific settings. These data reveal that DDR responses triggered by MHV68
      infection promote p53 activation. However, MHV68 encodes at least two proteins
      capable of limiting the potential consequences of p53 function. IMPORTANCE:
      Gammaherpesviruses are oncogenic herpesviruses that establish lifelong chronic
      infections. Defining how gammaherpesviruses overcome host responses to infection 
      is important for understanding how these viruses infect and cause disease. Here, 
      we establish that murine gammaherpesvirus 68 induces the activation of tumor
      suppressor p53. p53 activation was dependent on the DNA damage response kinase
      ataxia telangiectasia mutated. Although active early after infection, p53 became 
      dominantly inhibited as the infection cycle progressed. Viral inhibition of p53
      was mediated by the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 homologs of muSOX and mLANA. The
      inhibition of the p53 pathway enabled infected cells to evade p53-mediated cell
      death responses. These data demonstrate that a gammaherpesvirus encodes multiple 
      proteins to limit p53-mediated responses to productive viral infection, which
      likely benefits acute viral replication and the establishment of chronic
      infection.

TI  - Infection of a Single Cell Line with Distinct Strains of Human Cytomegalovirus
      Can Result in Large Variations in Virion Production and Facilitate Efficient
      Screening of Virus Protein Function.
PG  - 2523-35
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01762-15 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Previously, we reported that the absence of the ataxia telangiectasia
      mutated (ATM) kinase, a critical DNA damage response (DDR) signaling component
      for double-strand breaks, caused no change in HCMV Towne virion production.
      Later, others reported decreased AD169 viral titers in the absence of ATM. To
      address this discrepancy, human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) and three ATM(-) lines
      (GM02530, GM05823, and GM03395) were infected with both Towne and AD169. Two
      additional ATM(-) lines (GM02052 and GM03487) were infected with Towne.
      Remarkably, both previous studies' results were confirmed. However, the increased
      number of cell lines and infections with both lab-adapted strains confirmed that 
      ATM was not necessary to produce wild-type-level titers in fibroblasts. Instead, 
      interactions between individual virus strains and the cellular microenvironment
      of the individual ATM(-) line determined efficiency of virion production.
      Surprisingly, these two commonly used lab-adapted strains produced drastically
      different titers in one ATM(-) cell line, GM05823. The differences in titer
      suggested a rapid method for identifying genes involved in differential virion
      production. In silico comparison of the Towne and AD169 genomes determined a list
      of 28 probable candidates responsible for the difference. Using serial iterations
      of an experiment involving virion entry and input genome nuclear trafficking with
      a panel of related strains, we reduced this list to four (UL129, UL145, UL147,
      and UL148). As a proof of principle, reintroduction of UL148 largely rescued
      genome trafficking. Therefore, use of a battery of related strains offers an
      efficient method to narrow lists of candidate genes affecting various virus life 
      cycle checkpoints. IMPORTANCE: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection of multiple
      cell lines lacking ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein produced wild-type
      levels of infectious virus. Interactions between virus strains and the
      microenvironment of individual ATM(-) lines determined the efficiency of virion
      production. Infection of one ATM(-) cell line, GM05823, produced large titer
      differentials dependent on the strain used, Towne or AD169. This discrepancy
      resolved a disagreement in the literature of a requirement for ATM expression and
      HCMV reproduction. The titer differentials in GM08523 cells were due, in part, to
      a decreased capacity of AD169 virions to enter the cell and traffic genomes to
      the nucleus. In silico comparison of the Towne, AD169, and related variant
      strains' genomes was coupled with serial iterations of a virus entry experiment, 
      narrowing 28 candidate proteins responsible for the phenotype down to 4.
      Reintroduction of UL148 significantly rescued genome trafficking. Differential
      behavior of virus strains can be exploited to elucidate gene function.

      Adenovirus-infected Normal Human Cells.
LID - 10.3791/53296 [doi]
AB  - During infection of human cells by adenovirus (Ad), the host cell nucleus is
      dramatically reorganized, leading to formation of nuclear microenvironments
      through the recruitment of viral and cellular proteins to sites occupied by the
      viral genome. These sites, called replication compartments (RC), can be
      considered viral-induced nuclear domains where the viral genome is localized and 
      viral and cellular proteins that participate in replication, transcription and
      post-transcriptional processing are recruited. Moreover, cellular proteins
      involved in the antiviral response, such as tumor suppressor proteins, DNA damage
      response (DDR) components and innate immune response factors are also co-opted to
      RC. Although RC seem to play a crucial role to promote an efficient and
      productive replication cycle, a detailed analysis of their composition and
      associated activities has not been made. To facilitate the study of adenoviral RC
      and potentially those from other DNA viruses that replicate in the cell nucleus, 
      we adapted a simple procedure based on velocity gradients to isolate Ad RC and
      established a cell-free system amenable to conduct morphological, functional and 
      compositional studies of these virus-induced subnuclear structures, as well as to
      study their impact on host-cell interactions.

AB  - Every year, cervical cancer affects approximately 500,000 women worldwide, and
      approximately 275,000 patients die of this disease. The addition of platin-based 
      chemotherapy to primary radiotherapy has increased 5-year survival of
      advanced-stage cervical cancer patients, which is, however, still only 66%. One
      of the factors thought to contribute to treatment failure is the ability of tumor
      cells to repair chemoradiotherapy-induced DNA damage. Therefore, sensitization of
      tumor cells for chemoradiotherapy via inhibition of the DNA damage response (DDR)
      as a novel strategy to improve therapy effect, is currently studied
      pre-clinically as well as in the clinic. Almost invariably, cervical
      carcinogenesis involves infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV), which
      inactivates part of the DNA damage response. This HPV-mediated partial
      inactivation of the DDR presents therapeutic targeting of the residual DDR as an 
      interesting approach to achieve chemoradio-sensitization for cervical cancer. How
      the DDR can be most efficiently targeted, however, remains unclear. The fact that
      cisplatin and radiotherapy activate multiple signaling axes within the DDR
      further complicates a rational choice of therapeutic targets within the DDR. In
      this review, we provide an overview of the current preclinical and clinical
      knowledge about targeting the DDR in cervical cancer.

AB  - In response to cellular genome breaks, MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) activates a global 
      ATM DNA damage response (DDR) that prevents cellular replication. Here, we show
      that MRN-ATM also has critical functions in defending the cell against DNA
      viruses. We reveal temporally distinct responses to adenovirus genomes: a
      critical MRN-ATM DDR that must be inactivated by E1B-55K/E4-ORF3 viral
      oncoproteins and a global MRN-independent ATM DDR to viral nuclear domains that
      does not impact viral replication. We show that MRN binds to adenovirus genomes
      and activates a localized ATM response that specifically prevents viral DNA
      replication. In contrast to chromosomal breaks, ATM activation is not amplified
      by H2AX across megabases of chromatin to induce global signaling and replicative 
      arrest. Thus, gammaH2AX foci discriminate "self" and "non-self" genomes and
      determine whether a localized anti-viral or global ATM response is appropriate.
      This provides an elegant mechanism to neutralize viral genomes without
      jeopardizing cellular viability.

AB  - It is commonly assumed that there is a single canonical DNA damage response (DDR)
      that protects cells from various types of double-strand breaks and that its
      activation occurs via recognition of DNA ends by the DDR machinery. Recent work
      suggests that both assumptions may be oversimplifications. Here, we discuss
      several variations of the DDR in which the pathway is activated by diverse
      cellular events and/or generates distinct signaling outcomes. The existence of
      multiple non-canonical DDRs provides insights into how DNA damage is sensed and
      suggests a highly modular organization of the DDR.

TI  - HSV-I and the cellular DNA damage response.
PG  - 383-397
AB  - Peter Wildy first observed genetic recombination between strains of HSV in 1955. 
      At the time, knowledge of DNA repair mechanisms was limited, and it has only been
      in the last decade that particular DNA damage response (DDR) pathways have been
      examined in the context of viral infections. One of the first reports addressing 
      the interaction between a cellular DDR protein and HSV-1 was the observation by
      Lees-Miller et al. that DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit levels
      were depleted in an ICP0-dependent manner during Herpes simplex virus 1
      infection. Since then, there have been numerous reports describing the
      interactions between HSV infection and cellular DDR pathways. Due to space
      limitations, this review will focus predominantly on the most recent observations
      regarding how HSV navigates a potentially hostile environment to replicate its
      genome.

TI  - Early intranuclear replication of African swine fever virus genome modifies the

AB  - Although African swine fever virus (ASFV) replicates in viral cytoplasmic
      factories, the presence of viral DNA within the host cell nucleus has been
      previously reported to be essential for productive infection. Herein, we
      described, for the first time, the intranuclear distribution patterns of viral
      DNA replication events, preceding those that occur in the cytoplasmic
      compartment. Using BrdU pulse-labelling experiments, newly synthesized ASFV
      genomes were exclusively detected inside the host cell nucleus at the early phase
      of infection, both in swine monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and Vero cells.
      From 8hpi onwards, BrdU labelling was only observed in ASFV cytoplasmic
      factories. Our results also show that ASFV specifically activates the Ataxia
      Telangiectasia Mutated Rad-3 related (ATR) pathway in ASFV-infected swine MDMs
      from the early phase of infection, most probably because ASFV genome is
      recognized as foreign DNA. Morphological changes of promyelocytic leukaemia
      nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), nuclear speckles and Cajal bodies were also found in
      ASFV-infected swine MDMs, strongly suggesting the viral modulation of cellular
      antiviral responses and cellular transcription, respectively. As described for
      other viral infections, the nuclear reorganization that takes place during ASFV
      infection may also provide an environment that favours its intranuclear
      replication events. Altogether, our results contribute for a better understanding
      of ASFV replication strategies, starting with an essential intranuclear DNA
      replication phase which induces host nucleus changes towards a successful viral
      infection.

AB  - The characteristic feature of healthy living organisms is the preservation of
      homeostasis. Compelling evidence highlight that the DNA damage response and
      repair (DDR/R) and immune response (ImmR) signaling networks work together
      favoring the harmonized function of (multi)cellular organisms. DNA and RNA
      viruses activate the DDR/R machinery in the host cells both directly and
      indirectly. Activation of DDR/R in turn favors the immunogenicity of the
      incipient cell. Hence, stimulation of DDR/R by exogenous or endogenous insults
      triggers innate and adaptive ImmR. The immunogenic properties of ionizing
      radiation, a prototypic DDR/R inducer, serve as suitable examples of how DDR/R
      stimulation alerts host immunity. Thus, critical cellular danger signals
      stimulate defense at the systemic level and vice versa. Disruption of DDR/R-ImmR 
      cross talk compromises (multi)cellular integrity, leading to cell-cycle-related
      and immune defects. The emerging DDR/R-ImmR concept opens up a new avenue of
      therapeutic options, recalling the Hippocrates quote "everything in excess is
      opposed by nature."

TI  - Release of Soluble Ligands for the Activating NKG2D Receptor: One More Immune
      Evasion Strategy Evolved by HIV-1 ?
PG  - 54-64
AB  - Increasing lines of evidence indicate that NKG2D, an activating receptor of
      natural killer (NK) and CD8(+) T cells, plays an important role in immune
      responses against HIV-1. Through its ability to recognize a diverse array of
      ligands (NKG2DLs) induced by cell 'stress' such as viral infection, NKG2D
      delivers activating and co-stimulatory signals resulting in cytotoxicity and
      release of cytokines. Therefore, HIV-1 and other viruses have evolved clever
      mechanisms to counteract NKG2D-dependent immune responses. While, on one hand,
      the HIV-1 Vpr protein up-regulates NKG2DLs expression by activating the DNA
      damage response (DDR) pathway, other viral proteins (Nef and Vif) have developed 
      the capacity to reduce NKG2DLs expression levels. In addition, recent evidences
      suggest that HIV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells may release NKG2DLs, particularly
      MICA, in soluble form, a phenomenon that has the potential to down-modulate NKG2D
      on circulating lymphocytes and allow evasion of NKG2D-mediated immune responses. 
      Indeed, despite controversial, lower NKG2D expression was found on both NK and
      CD8(+) T cells in HIV-1-infected patients. This review discusses recent advances 
      in the understanding of how HIV-1 affects the NKG2D/NKG2DLs system, with a
      special focus on virus-induced release of soluble NKG2DLs and its functional
      implications for the immune surveillance of the infected host.

TI  - BRCA1 Regulates IFI16 Mediated Nuclear Innate Sensing of Herpes Viral DNA and
      Subsequent Induction of the Innate Inflammasome and Interferon-beta Responses.
PG  - e1005030
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005030 [doi]
AB  - The innate immune system pattern recognition receptors (PRR) are the first line
      of host defenses recognizing the various pathogen- or danger-associated molecular
      patterns and eliciting defenses by regulating the production of pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-18 or interferon beta (IFN-beta). NOD-like
      receptors (NLRs) and AIM2-like receptors (ALRs) are cytoplasmic inflammasome
      sensors of foreign molecules, including DNA. IFI16, a sequence-independent
      nuclear innate sensor ALR, recognizes episomal dsDNA genomes of herpes viruses
      such as KSHV, EBV, and HSV-1 in the infected cell nuclei, forms an inflammasome
      complex with ASC and procaspase1, and relocates into the cytoplasm leading into
      Caspase-1 and IL-1beta generation. IFI16 also induces IFN-beta during HSV-1
      infection via the cytoplasmic STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway. Thus far, whether IFI16
      recognizes foreign DNA directly or utilizes other host protein(s) is unknown.
      Here, we demonstrate that BRCA1, a DNA damage repair sensor and transcription
      regulator, is in complex with IFI16 in the host cell nucleus, and their
      association increases in the presence of nuclear viral genomes during de novo
      KSHV, EBV and HSV-1 infection, and in latent KSHV or EBV infection, but not by
      DNA damage responses (DDR) induced by bleomycin and vaccinia virus cytoplasmic
      dsDNA. BRCA1 is a constituent of the triggered IFI16-inflammasome and is
      translocated into the cytoplasm after genome recognition along with the
      IFI16-inflammasome. The absence of BRCA1 abrogated IFI16-viral genome
      association, inflammasome assembly, IFI16 cytoplasmic localization, and Caspase-1
      and IL-1beta production. The absence of BRCA1 also abolished the cytoplasmic
      IFI16-STING interaction, downstream IRF3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation
      of pIRF3 and IFN-beta production during de novo KSHV and HSV-1 infection. These
      findings highlight that BRCA1 plays a hitherto unidentified innate
      immunomodulatory role by facilitating nuclear foreign DNA sensing by IFI16,
      subsequent assembly and cytoplasmic distribution of IFI16-inflammasomes leading
      into IL-1beta formation and the induction of IFN-beta via cytoplasmic signaling
      through IFI16-STING, TBK1 and IRF3.

TI  - Human parvovirus B19: a mechanistic overview of infection and DNA replication.
PG  - 155-167
AB  - Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) is a human pathogen that belongs to genus
      Erythroparvovirus of the Parvoviridae family, which is composed of a group of
      small DNA viruses with a linear single-stranded DNA genome. B19V mainly infects
      human erythroid progenitor cells and causes mild to severe hematological
      disorders in patients. However, recent clinical studies indicate that B19V also
      infects nonerythroid lineage cells, such as myocardial endothelial cells, and may
      be associated with other disease outcomes. Several cell culture systems,
      including permissive and semipermissive erythroid lineage cells, nonpermissive
      human embryonic kidney 293 cells and recently reported myocardial endothelial
      cells, have been used to study the mechanisms underlying B19V infection and B19V 
      DNA replication. This review aims to summarize recent advances in B19V studies
      with a focus on the mechanisms of B19V tropism specific to different cell types
      and the cellular pathways involved in B19V DNA replication including cellular
      signaling transduction and cell cycle arrest.

TI  - Activation of DNA Damage Response Pathways during Lytic Replication of KSHV.
PG  - 2908-27
LID - 10.3390/v7062752 [doi]
AB  - Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of several 
      human malignancies. Human tumour viruses such as KSHV are known to interact with 
      the DNA damage response (DDR), the molecular pathways that recognise and repair
      lesions in cellular DNA. Here it is demonstrated that lytic reactivation of KSHV 
      leads to activation of the ATM and DNA-PK DDR kinases resulting in
      phosphorylation of multiple downstream substrates. Inhibition of ATM results in
      the reduction of overall levels of viral replication while inhibition of DNA-PK
      increases activation of ATM and leads to earlier viral release. There is no
      activation of the ATR-CHK1 pathway following lytic replication and CHK1
      phosphorylation is inhibited at later times during the lytic cycle. Despite
      evidence of double-strand breaks and phosphorylation of H2AX, 53BP1 foci are not 
      consistently observed in cells containing lytic virus although RPA32 and MRE11
      localise to sites of viral DNA synthesis. Activation of the DDR following KSHV
      lytic reactivation does not result in a G1 cell cycle block and cells are able to
      proceed to S-phase during the lytic cycle. KSHV appears then to selectively
      activate DDR pathways, modulate cell cycle progression and recruit DDR proteins
      to sites of viral replication during the lytic cycle.

PG  - 1214-9
LID - 10.1080/15384047.2015.1056419 [doi]
AB  - The major known function of cytokines that belong to type I interferons (IFN,
      including IFNalpha and IFNbeta) is to mount the defense against viruses. This
      function also protects the genetic information of host cells from alterations in 
      the genome elicited by some of these viruses. Furthermore, recent studies
      demonstrated that IFN also restrict proliferation of damaged cells by inducing
      cell senescence. Here we investigated the subsequent role of IFN in elimination
      of the senescent cells. Our studies demonstrate that endogenous IFN produced by
      already senescent cells contribute to increased expression of the natural killer 
      (NK) receptor ligands, including MIC-A and ULBP2. Furthermore, neutralization of 
      endogenous IFN or genetic ablation of its receptor chain IFNAR1 compromises the
      recognition of senescent cells and their clearance in vitro and in vivo. We
      discuss the role of IFN in protecting the multi-cellular host from accumulation
      of damaged senescent cells and potential significance of this mechanism in human 
      cancers.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects and replicates in quiescent
      hepatocytes, which are deficient in dNTPs, the critical precursors of HBV
      replication. Most tumor viruses promote dNTP production in host cells by inducing
      cell proliferation. Although HBV is known as a major cause of hepatocellular
      carcinoma, it does not lead to cellular proliferation. Instead, HBV acquires
      dNTPs by activating the expression of the R2 subunit of the Ribonucleotide
      Reductase (RNR) holoenzyme, the cell cycle gene that is rate-limiting for
      generation of dNTPs, without inducing the cell cycle. We wished to elucidate the 
      molecular basis of HBV-dependent R2 expression in quiescent cells. METHODS:
      Quiescent HepG2 cells were transduced with an HBV-containing lentiviral vector,
      and primary human hepatocytes were infected with HBV. DNA damage response and
      RNR-R2 gene expression were monitored under this condition. RESULTS: We report
      here that HBV-induced R2 expression is mediated by the E2F1 transcription factor,
      and that HBV induces E2F1 accumulation, modification and binding to the R2
      promoter. We found that Chk1, a known E2F1 kinase that functions in response to
      DNA damage, was activated by HBV. In cells where Chk1 was pharmacologically
      inhibited, or depleted by shRNA-mediated knockdown, HBV-mediated R2 expression
      was severely attenuated. Furthermore, we found that HBV attenuates DNA repair,
      thus reducing cellular dNTP consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate
      that HBV exploits the Chk1-E2F1 axis of the DNA damage response pathway to induce
      R2 expression in a cell cycle-independent manner. This suggests that inhibition
      of this pathway may have a therapeutic value for HBV carriers.

LID - 10.3390/v7052542 [doi]
AB  - With between 10% and 15% of human cancers attributable to viral infection, there 
      is great interest, from both a scientific and clinical viewpoint, as to how these
      pathogens modulate host cell functions. Seven human tumour viruses have been
      identified as being involved in the development of specific malignancies. It has 
      long been known that the introduction of chromosomal aberrations is a common
      feature of viral infections. Intensive research over the past two decades has
      subsequently revealed that viruses specifically interact with cellular mechanisms
      responsible for the recognition and repair of DNA lesions, collectively known as 
      the DNA damage response (DDR). These interactions can involve activation and
      deactivation of individual DDR pathways as well as the recruitment of specific
      proteins to sites of viral replication. Since the DDR has evolved to protect the 
      genome from the accumulation of deleterious mutations, deregulation is inevitably
      associated with an increased risk of tumour formation. This review summarises the
      current literature regarding the complex relationship between known human tumour 
      viruses and the DDR and aims to shed light on how these interactions can
      contribute to genomic instability and ultimately the development of human
      cancers.

AB  - The DNA damage response (DDR) maintains genomic integrity through an elaborate
      network of signaling pathways that sense DNA damage and recruit effector factors 
      to repair damaged DNA. DDR signaling pathways are usurped and manipulated by the 
      replication programs of many viruses. Here, we review the papillomavirus (PV)
      life cycle, highlighting current knowledge of how PVs recruit and engage the DDR 
      to facilitate productive infection.

TI  - Epstein-Barr virus BZLF1 protein impairs accumulation of host DNA damage proteins
      at damage sites in response to DNA damage.
PG  - 937-50
LID - 10.1038/labinvest.2015.69 [doi]
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is closely associated with several human
      malignancies including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The EBV immediate-early
      protein BZLF1 is the key mediator that switches EBV infection from latent to
      lytic forms. The lytic form of EBV infection has been implicated in human
      carcinogenesis but its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. BZLF1 has been shown 
      to be a binding partner of several DNA damage response (DDR) proteins. Its
      functions in host DDR remain unknown. Thus, we explore the effects of BZLF1 on
      cellular response to DNA damage in NPC cells. We found that expression of BZLF1
      impaired the binding between RNF8 and MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1),
      which in turn interfered with the localization of RNF8 and 53BP1 to the DNA
      damage sites. The RNF8-53BP1 pathway is important for repair of DNA double-strand
      breaks and DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint activation. Our results showed
      that, by impairing DNA damage repair as well as abrogating G2/M checkpoint, BZLF1
      induced genomic instability and rendered cells more sensitive to ionizing
      radiation. Moreover, the blockage of 53BP1 and RNF8 foci formation was
      recapitulated in EBV-infected cells. Taken together, our study raises the
      possibility that, by causing mis-localization of important DDR proteins, BZLF1
      may function as a link between lytic EBV infection and impaired DNA damage
      repair, thus contributing to the carcinogenesis of EBV-associated human
      epithelial malignancies.

TI  - Regulation of DNA Damage Signaling and Cell Death Responses by Epstein-Barr Virus
      Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1) and LMP2A in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Cells.
PG  - 7612-24
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00958-15 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is closely associated with latent
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Although EBV infection of preneoplastic
      epithelial cells is not immortalizing, EBV can modulate oncogenic and cell death 
      mechanisms. The viral latent membrane proteins 1 (LMP1) and LMP2A are
      consistently expressed in NPC and can cooperate in bitransgenic mice expressed
      from the keratin-14 promoter to enhance carcinoma development in an epithelial
      chemical carcinogenesis model. In this study, LMP1 and LMP2A were coexpressed in 
      the EBV-negative NPC cell line HK1 and examined for combined effects in response 
      to genotoxic treatments. In response to DNA damage activation, LMP1 and LMP2A
      coexpression reduced gammaH2AX (S139) phosphorylation and caspase cleavage
      induced by a lower dose (5 muM) of the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide.
      Regulation of gammaH2AX occurred before the onset of caspase activation without
      modulation of other DNA damage signaling mediators, including ATM, Chk1, or Chk2,
      and additionally was suppressed by inducers of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs)
      and replication stress. Despite reduced DNA damage repair signaling, LMP1-2A
      coexpressing cells recovered from cytotoxic doses of etoposide; however, LMP1
      expression was sufficient for this effect. LMP1 and LMP2A coexpression did not
      enhance cell growth, with a moderate increase of cell motility to fibronectin.
      This study supports that LMP1 and LMP2A jointly regulate DNA repair signaling and
      cell death activation with no further enhancement in the growth properties of
      neoplastic cells. IMPORTANCE: NPC is characterized by clonal EBV infection and
      accounts for >78,000 annual cancer cases with increased incidence in regions
      where EBV is endemic, such as southeast Asia. The latent proteins LMP1 and LMP2A 
      coexpressed in NPC can individually enhance growth or survival properties in
      epithelial cells, but their combined effects and potential regulation of DNA
      repair and checkpoint mechanisms are relatively undetermined. In this study,
      LMP1-2A coexpression suppressed activation of the DNA damage response (DDR)
      protein gammaH2AX induced by selective genotoxins that promote DNA replication
      stress or SSBs. Expression of LMP1 was sufficient to recover cells, resulting in 
      outgrowth of LMP1 and LMP1-2A-coexpressing cells and indicating distinct
      LMP1-dependent effects in the restoration of replicative potential. These
      findings demonstrate novel properties for LMP1 and LMP2A in the cooperative
      modulation of DDR and apoptotic signaling pathways, further implicating both
      proteins in the progression of NPC and epithelial malignancies.

TI  - DNA Damage Signaling Is Induced in the Absence of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Lytic 
      DNA Replication and in Response to Expression of ZEBRA.
PG  - e0126088
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0126088 [doi]
AB  - Epstein Barr virus (EBV), like other oncogenic viruses, modulates the activity of
      cellular DNA damage responses (DDR) during its life cycle. Our aim was to
      characterize the role of early lytic proteins and viral lytic DNA replication in 
      activation of DNA damage signaling during the EBV lytic cycle. Our data challenge
      the prevalent hypothesis that activation of DDR pathways during the EBV lytic
      cycle occurs solely in response to large amounts of exogenous double stranded DNA
      products generated during lytic viral DNA replication. In immunofluorescence or
      immunoblot assays, DDR activation markers, specifically phosphorylated ATM
      (pATM), H2AX (gammaH2AX), or 53BP1 (p53BP1), were induced in the presence or
      absence of viral DNA amplification or replication compartments during the EBV
      lytic cycle. In assays with an ATM inhibitor and DNA damaging reagents in Burkitt
      lymphoma cell lines, gammaH2AX induction was necessary for optimal expression of 
      early EBV genes, but not sufficient for lytic reactivation. Studies in lytically 
      reactivated EBV-positive cells in which early EBV proteins, BGLF4, BGLF5, or
      BALF2, were not expressed showed that these proteins were not necessary for DDR
      activation during the EBV lytic cycle. Expression of ZEBRA, a viral protein that 
      is necessary for EBV entry into the lytic phase, induced pATM foci and gammaH2AX 
      independent of other EBV gene products. ZEBRA mutants deficient in DNA binding,
      Z(R183E) and Z(S186E), did not induce foci of pATM. ZEBRA co-localized with
      HP1beta, a heterochromatin associated protein involved in DNA damage signaling.
      We propose a model of DDR activation during the EBV lytic cycle in which ZEBRA
      induces ATM kinase phosphorylation, in a DNA binding dependent manner, to
      modulate gene expression. ATM and H2AX phosphorylation induced prior to EBV
      replication may be critical for creating a microenvironment of viral and cellular
      gene expression that enables lytic cycle progression.

TI  - Polyomavirus interaction with the DNA damage response.
PG  - 122-9
LID - 10.1007/s12250-015-3583-6 [doi]
AB  - Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that subvert cellular metabolism and
      pathways to mediate their own replication-normally at the expense of the host
      cell. Polyomaviruses are a group of small DNA viruses, which have long been
      studied as a model for eukaryotic DNA replication. Polyomaviruses manipulate host
      replication proteins, as well as proteins involved in DNA maintenance and repair,
      to serve as essential cofactors for productive infection. Moreover, evidence
      suggests that polyomavirus infection poses a unique genotoxic threat to the host 
      cell. In response to any source of DNA damage, cells must initiate an effective
      DNA damage response (DDR) to maintain genomic integrity, wherein two protein
      kinases, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR), are
      major regulators of DNA damage recognition and repair. Recent investigation
      suggests that these essential DDR proteins are required for productive
      polyomavirus infection. This review will focus on polyomaviruses and their
      interaction with ATM- and ATR-mediated DNA damage responses and the effect of
      this interaction on host genomic stability.

TI  - Impact of the MRN Complex on Adeno-Associated Virus Integration and Replication
      during Coinfection with Herpes Simplex Virus 1.
PG  - 6824-34
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00171-15 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a helper-dependent parvovirus that
      requires coinfection with adenovirus (AdV) or herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) to
      replicate. In the absence of the helper virus, AAV can persist in an episomal or 
      integrated form. Previous studies have analyzed the DNA damage response (DDR)
      induced upon AAV replication to understand how it controls AAV replication. In
      particular, it was shown that the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, a major player 
      of the DDR induced by double-stranded DNA breaks and stalled replication forks,
      could negatively regulate AdV and AAV replication during coinfection. In
      contrast, MRN favors HSV-1 replication and is recruited to AAV replication
      compartments that are induced in the presence of HSV-1. In this study, we
      examined the role of MRN during AAV replication induced by HSV-1. Our results
      indicated that knockdown of MRN significantly reduced AAV DNA replication after
      coinfection with wild-type (wt) HSV-1 or HSV-1 with the polymerase deleted. This 
      effect was specific to wt AAV, since it did not occur with recombinant AAV
      vectors. Positive regulation of AAV replication by MRN was dependent on its DNA
      tethering activity but did not require its nuclease activities. Importantly,
      knockdown of MRN also negatively regulated AAV integration within the human AAVS1
      site, both in the presence and in the absence of HSV-1. Altogether, this work
      identifies a new function of MRN during integration of the AAV genome and
      demonstrates that this DNA repair complex positively regulates AAV replication in
      the presence of HSV-1. IMPORTANCE: Viral DNA genomes trigger a DNA damage
      response (DDR), which can be either detrimental or beneficial for virus
      replication. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a defective parvovirus that requires
      the help of an unrelated virus such as adenovirus (AdV) or herpes simplex virus 1
      (HSV-1) for productive replication. Previous studies have demonstrated that the
      cellular Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, a sensor and regulator of the DDR,
      negatively regulates AAV replication during coinfection with AdV, which
      counteracts this effect by inactivating the complex. Here, we demonstrate that
      MRN positively regulates AAV replication during coinfection with HSV-1.
      Importantly, our study also indicates that MRN also favors integration of AAV
      genomes within the human AAVS1 site. Altogether, this work indicates that MRN
      differentially regulates AAV replication depending on the helper virus which is
      present and identifies a new function of this DNA repair complex during AAV
      integration.

AB  - Although the number of identified avian-borne picornaviruses (family
      Picornaviridae) is continuously increasing there remains several species-rich
      avian host groups, such as the order Falconiformes (with 290 bird species) from
      which picornaviruses have not been identified. This study reports the first
      complete genome of a novel, highly divergent picornavirus, named as Falcovirus A1
      (KP230449), from the carnivorous bird, the common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus,
      order Falconiformes). Falcovirus A1 has the longest 3D(RdRp) genome region and
      distant phylogenetic relationship to the Hepatitis A virus 1 (Hepatovirus) and
      Avian encephalomyelitis virus 1 (Tremovirus). It has a type-I (enterovirus-like) 
      IRES in the 5'UTR - identified for the first time among avian-borne
      picornaviruses suggesting that type-I IRES is not restricted only to
      enteroviruses and providing further evidence of mosaicism of this region among
      different picornavirus genera.

AB  - Most human papillomavirus (HPV) antiviral strategies have focused upon inhibiting
      viral DNA replication, but it is increasingly apparent that viral DNA levels can 
      be chemically controlled by approaches that promote its instability. HPVs and
      other DNA viruses have a tenuous relationship with their hosts. They must
      replicate and hide from the DNA damage response (DDR) and innate immune systems, 
      which serve to protect cells from foreign or "non-self" DNA, and yet they draft
      these same systems to support their life cycles. DNA binding antiviral agents
      promoting massive viral DNA instability and elimination are reviewed. Mechanistic
      studies of these agents have identified genetic antiviral enhancers and
      repressors, antiviral sensitizers, and host cell elements that protect and
      stabilize HPV genomes. Viral DNA degradation appears to be an important means of 
      controlling HPV DNA levels in some cases, but the underlying mechanisms remain
      poorly understood. These findings may prove useful not only for understanding
      viral DNA persistence but also in devising future antiviral strategies.

AB  - This brief paper is based on the Coimbra 'conference presentation by the
      moderator', prior to the two main lectures on pathogen reduction treatment [PRT] 
      of plasma. Being an educationist and teacher in core and having a great interest 
      to simplify the message convey to conference' participants and readers I decided 
      to maintain the slide format of the presentation. To highlight most effectively
      the role played by pathogen reduction to supplement the multilayer-strategy
      already in place, emphasizes were placed by going back to basic focusing on:
      where we were, where we are now and where we are going!. The unresolved problems 
      of viral safety of blood components and criteria of universal acceptability of
      PRT are highlighted so is the need for further DDR strategies both in incremental
      and innovative ways. Finally the issue of who would benefit from implementation
      of PRT is described based on published data and also providing some visionary
      foresights for the long term benefits of PRT in both optimizing the safety of
      blood supply and helping at least in health care containment. I hope this new
      approach will be useful to readers, providing at least some conceptual and
      technical supports in understanding the role of PRT in optimizing the safety of
      blood supply.

TI  - Annexin-1 regulated by HAUSP is essential for UV-induced damage response.
PG  - e1654
LID - 10.1038/cddis.2015.32 [doi]
AB  - DNA damage can occur through diverse stimulations such as toxins, drugs, and
      environmental factors. To respond to DNA damage, mammalian cells induce DNA
      damage response (DDR). DDR signal activates a rapid signal transduction pathway, 
      regulating the cell fate based on the damaged cell condition. Moreover, serious
      damaged cells have to be eliminated by the macrophage to maintain homeostasis.
      Because the DDR induces genomic instability followed by tumor formation,
      targeting the DDR signaling can be applied for the cancer therapy. Herpes
      virus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP/USP7) is one of the
      well-known deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) owing to its relevance with Mdm2-p53
      complex. The involvement of HAUSP in DDR through p53 led us to investigate novel 
      substrates for HAUSP, which is related to DDR or apoptosis. As a result, we
      identified annexin-1 (ANXA1) as one of the putative substrates for HAUSP. ANXA1
      has numerous roles in cellular systems including anti-inflammation, damage
      response, and apoptosis. Several studies have demonstrated that ANXA1 can be
      modified in a post-translational manner by processes such as phosphorylation,
      SUMOylation, and ubiquitination. In addition, DNA damage gives various functions 
      to ANXA1 such as stress response or cleavage-mediated apoptotic cell clearance.
      In the current study, our proteomic analysis using two-dimensional
      electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass 
      spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and nano LC-MS/MS, and immunoprecipitation revealed
      that ANXA1 binds to HAUSP through its HAUSP-binding motif (P/AXXS), and the
      cleavage and damage-responsive functions of ANXA1 upon UV-induced DNA damage may 
      be followed by HAUSP-mediated deubiquitination of ANXA1. Intriguingly, the
      UV-induced damage responses via HAUSP-ANXA1 interaction in HeLa cells were
      different from the responses shown in the Jurkat cells, suggesting that their
      change of roles may depend on the cell types.

AB  - The cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK-5) activating protein, p35, is important for
      acute herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) replication in mice. This report shows that 
      HSV-1 increases p35 levels, changes the primary localization of CDK-5 from the
      nucleus to the cytoplasm, and enhances CDK-5 activity during lytic or acute
      infection. Infected neurons also stained positive for the DNA damage response
      (DDR) marker gammaH2AX. We propose that CDK-5 is activated by the DDR to protect 
      infected neurons from apoptosis.

TI  - Viral DNA replication-dependent DNA damage response activation during BK
      polyomavirus infection.
PG  - 5032-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.03650-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) reactivation is associated with severe human 
      disease in kidney and bone marrow transplant patients. The interplay between
      viral and host factors that regulates the productive infection process remains
      poorly understood. We have previously reported that the cellular DNA damage
      response (DDR) is activated upon lytic BKPyV infection and that its activation is
      required for optimal viral replication in primary kidney epithelial cells. In
      this report, we set out to determine what viral components are responsible for
      activating the two major phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases (PI3KKs)
      involved in the DDR: ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase and ATM and
      Rad3-related (ATR) kinase. Using a combination of UV treatment, lentivirus
      transduction, and mutant virus infection experiments, our results demonstrate
      that neither the input virus nor the expression of large T antigen (TAg) alone is
      sufficient to trigger the activation of ATM or ATR in our primary culture model. 
      Instead, our data suggest that the activation of both the ATM- and ATR-mediated
      DDR pathways is linked to viral DNA replication. Intriguingly, a TAg mutant virus
      that is unable to activate the DDR causes substantial host DNA damage. Our study 
      provides insight into how DDRs are activated by polyomaviruses in primary cells
      with intact cell cycle checkpoints and how the activation might be linked to the 
      maintenance of host genome stability. IMPORTANCE: Polyomaviruses are
      opportunistic pathogens that are associated with several human diseases under
      immunosuppressed conditions. BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) affects mostly kidney and
      bone marrow transplant patients. The detailed replication mechanism of these
      viruses remains to be determined. We have previously reported that BKPyV
      activates the host DNA damage response (DDR), a response normally used by the
      host cell to combat genotoxic stress, to aid its own replication. In this study, 
      we identified that the trigger for DDR activation is viral replication.
      Furthermore, we show that the virus is able to cause host DNA damage in the
      absence of viral replication and DDR activation. These results suggest an
      intricate relationship between viral replication, DDR activation, and host genome
      instability.

AB  - The European Union regulation for blood establishments does not require the
      evaluation of measurement uncertainty in virology screening tests, which is
      required by ISO 15189 guideline following GUM principles. GUM modular approaches 
      have been discussed by medical laboratory researchers but no consensus has been
      achieved regarding practical application. Meanwhile, the application of empirical
      approaches fulfilling GUM principles has gained support. Blood establishments'
      screening tests accredited by ISO 15189 need to select an appropriate model even 
      GUM models are intended uniquely for quantitative examination procedures.
      Alternative (to GUM) models focused on probability have been proposed in medical 
      laboratories' diagnostic tests. This article reviews, discusses and proposes
      models for diagnostic accuracy in blood establishments' screening tests. The
      output of these models is an alternative to VIM's measurement uncertainty
      concept. Example applications are provided for an anti-HCV test where
      calculations were performed using a commercial spreadsheet. The results show that
      these models satisfy ISO 15189 principles and that the estimation of clinical
      sensitivity, clinical specificity, binary results agreement and area under the
      ROC curve are alternatives to the measurement uncertainty concept.

TI  - Nitric oxide donors increase PVR/CD155 DNAM-1 ligand expression in multiple
      myeloma cells: role of DNA damage response activation.
PG  - 17

AB  - BACKGROUND: DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM-1) is an activating receptor
      constitutively expressed by macrophages/dendritic cells and by T lymphocytes and 
      Natural Killer (NK) cells, having an important role in anticancer responses; in
      this regard, combination therapies able to enhance the expression of DNAM-1
      ligands on tumor cells are of therapeutic interest. In this study, we
      investigated the effect of different nitric oxide (NO) donors on the expression
      of the DNAM-1 ligand Poliovirus Receptor/CD155 (PVR/CD155) in multiple myeloma
      (MM) cells. METHODS: Six MM cell lines, SKO-007(J3), U266, OPM-2, RPMI-8226, ARK 
      and LP1 were used to investigate the activity of different nitric oxide donors
      [DETA-NO and the NO-releasing prodrugs NCX4040 (NO-aspirin) and JS-K] on the
      expression of PVR/CD155, using Flow Cytometry and Real-Time PCR. Western-blot and
      specific inhibitors were employed to investigate the role of soluble guanylyl
      cyclase/cGMP and activation of the DNA damage response (DDR). RESULTS: Our
      results indicate that increased levels of nitric oxide can upregulate PVR/CD155
      cell surface and mRNA expression in MM cells; in addition, exposure to nitric
      oxide donors renders myeloma cells more efficient to activate NK cell
      degranulation and enhances their ability to trigger NK cell-mediated
      cytotoxicity. We found that activation of the soluble guanylyl cyclase and
      increased cGMP concentrations by nitric oxide is not involved in the
      up-regulation of ligand expression. On the contrary, treatment of MM cells with
      nitric oxide donors correlated with the activation of a DNA damage response
      pathway and inhibition of the ATM /ATR/Chk1/2 kinase activities by specific
      inhibitors significantly abrogates up-regulation. CONCLUSIONS: The present study 
      provides evidence that regulation of the PVR/CD155 DNAM-1 ligand expression by
      nitric oxide may represent an additional immune-mediated mechanism and supports
      the anti-myeloma activity of nitric oxide donors.

TI  - Activation of checkpoint kinase 2 is critical for herpes simplex virus type 1
      replication in corneal epithelium.
PG  - 55-64
LID - 10.1159/000366228 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I keratitis remains a leading
      cause of corneal morbidity, despite the availability of effective antiviral
      drugs. Improved understanding of virus-host interactions at the level of the host
      DNA damage response (DDR), a known factor in the development of HSV-1 keratitis, 
      may shed light on potential new therapeutic targets. This report examines the
      role of checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), a DDR mediator protein, in corneal epithelial
      HSV-1 infection. METHODS: A small-molecule inhibitor of Chk2 (Chk2 inhibitor II) 
      was applied to HSV-1-infected cultured human corneal epithelial cells (hTCEpi and
      HCE) as well as to explanted and organotypically cultured human and rabbit
      corneas. Infection levels were assessed by plaque assay and real-time PCR.
      RNAi-mediated depletion of Chk2 was performed to confirm the effect of the
      inhibitor. RESULTS: Inhibition of the Chk2 kinase activity greatly suppresses the
      cytopathic effect, genome replication and infectious progeny production in vitro 
      and ex vivo. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates the critical role of Chk2
      kinase in the establishment of HSV-1 corneal epithelial infection. These data
      contribute to our understanding of herpesvirus-host interactions and underscore
      the significance of DDR activation in HSV-1 keratitis.

AB  - The members of the genus Avihepatovirus and related picornaviruses ("Aalivius")
      of ducks, turkey and chickens possess identical 2A peptide composition including 
      three functionally unrelated 2A peptides which is a characteristic genome feature
      of these monophyletic avian picornaviruses. The complete genome of a novel
      picornavirus provisionally named Orivirus A1 (KM203656) from a cloacal sample of 
      a 4-week-old diarrheic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) distantly related to
      members of genus Avihepatovirus was characterized. The study strain contains a
      type-II-like IRES, a single 2A protein of unknown function unrelated to the 2A
      proteins of avihepatoviruses and a long 3' untranslated region (UTR) with
      multiple repeated sequence motifs followed by an AUG-rich region. The repeated
      sequences of the 3' UTR show significant identity to the "Unit A" sequences of
      the phylogenetically distant megriviruses. The presence of a novel single 2A and 
      the megrivirus-like "Unit A" motifs suggest multiple recombination events in the 
      evolution of this novel picornavirus.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA integrations may affect therapeutic responses in
      cancers through ATM network-related DNA damage response (DDR). We studied whether
      cisplatin-induced DDR was altered in human HK-2 renal tubular cells immortalized 
      by HPV16 E6/E7 genes. Cytotoxicity assays utilized thiazolyl blue dye and DDR was
      identified by gene expression differences, double-strand DNA breaks, ATM promoter
      activity, and analysis of cell cycling and side population cells. After
      cisplatin, HK-2 cells showed greater ATM promoter activity indicating activation 
      of this network, but DDR was muted, since little gammaH2AX was expressed, DNA
      strand breaks were absent and cells continued cycling. When HK-2 cells were
      treated with the MDM2 antagonist inducing p53, nutlin-3, or p53 transcriptional
      activator, tenovin-1, cell growth decreased but cisplatin toxicity was
      unaffected. By contrast, arsenic trioxide, which by inhibiting wild-type
      p53-induced phosphatase-1 that serves responses downstream of p53, and by
      depolymerizing tubulin, synergistically enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity including
      loss of SP cells. Our findings demonstrated that HPV16 E6/E7 altered DDR through 
      p53-mediated cell growth controls, which may be overcome by targeting of WIP1 and
      other processes, and thus should be relevant for treating renal cell carcinoma.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Viruses interact with and regulate many host metabolic pathways in
      order to advance the viral life cycle and counteract intrinsic and extrinsic
      antiviral responses. The human adenovirus (Ad) early protein E4-ORF3 forms a
      unique scaffold throughout the nuclei of infected cells and inhibits multiple
      antiviral defenses, including a DNA damage response (DDR) and an interferon
      response. We previously reported that the Ad5 E4-ORF3 protein induces sumoylation
      of Mre11 and Nbs1, which are essential for the DDR, and their relocalization into
      E4-ORF3-induced nuclear inclusions is required for this modification to occur. In
      this study, we sought to analyze a global change in ubiquitin-like (Ubl)
      modifications, with particular focus on SUMO3, by the Ad5 E4-ORF3 protein and to 
      identify new substrates with these modifications. By a comparative proteome-wide 
      approach utilizing immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry, we found that Ubl
      modifications of 166 statistically significant lysine sites in 51 proteins are
      affected by E4-ORF3, and the proteome of modifications spans a diverse range of
      cellular functions. Ubl modifications of 92% of these identified sites were
      increased by E4-ORF3. We further analyzed SUMO3 conjugation of several identified
      proteins. Our findings demonstrated a role for the Ad5 E4-ORF3 protein as a
      regulator of Ubl modifications and revealed new SUMO3 substrates induced by
      E4-ORF3. IMPORTANCE: The adenovirus E4-ORF3 protein induces dynamic structural
      changes in the nuclei of infected cells and counteracts host antiviral responses.
      One of the mechanisms that accounts for this process is the relocalization and
      sequestration of cellular proteins into an E4-ORF3 nuclear scaffold, but little
      is known about how this small viral protein affects diverse cellular responses.
      In this study, we analyzed for the first time the global pattern of
      ubiquitin-like (Ubl) modifications, with particular focus on SUMO3, altered by
      E4-ORF3 expression. The results suggest a role for the Ad5 E4-ORF3 protein as a
      regulator of Ubl modifications and reveal new SUMO3 substrates targeted by
      E4-ORF3. Our findings propose Ubl modifications as a new mechanism by which
      E4-ORF3 may modulate cellular protein functions in addition to subnuclear
      relocalization.

AB  - Viruses must interact with their hosts in order to replicate; these interactions 
      often provoke the evolutionarily conserved response to DNA damage, known as the
      DNA damage response (DDR). The DDR can be activated by incoming viral DNA, during
      the integration of retroviruses, or in response to the aberrant DNA structures
      generated upon replication of DNA viruses. Furthermore, DNA and RNA viral
      proteins can induce the DDR by promoting inappropriate S phase entry, by
      modifying cellular DDR factors directly, or by unintentionally targeting host
      DNA. The DDR may be antiviral, although viruses often require proximal DDR
      activation of repair and recombination factors to facilitate replication as well 
      as downstream DDR signaling suppression to ensure cell survival. An unintended
      consequence of DDR attenuation during infection is the long-term survival and
      proliferation of precancerous cells. Therefore, the molecular basis for DDR
      activation and attenuation by viruses remains an important area of study that
      will likely provide key insights into how viruses have evolved with their hosts.

TI  - Role of ATM in the formation of the replication compartment during lytic
      replication of Epstein-Barr virus in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells.
PG  - 652-68
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01437-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a type of oncogenic herpesvirus, is
      associated with human malignancies. Previous studies have shown that lytic
      reactivation of EBV in latently infected cells induces an ATM-dependent DNA
      damage response (DDR). The involvement of ATM activation has been implicated in
      inducing viral lytic gene transcription to promote lytic reactivation. Its
      contribution to the formation of a replication compartment during lytic
      reactivation of EBV remains poorly defined. In this study, the role of ATM in
      viral DNA replication was investigated in EBV-infected nasopharyngeal epithelial 
      cells. We observed that induction of lytic infection of EBV triggers ATM
      activation and localization of DDR proteins at the viral replication
      compartments. Suppression of ATM activity using a small interfering RNA (siRNA)
      approach or a specific chemical inhibitor profoundly suppressed replication of
      EBV DNA and production of infectious virions in EBV-infected cells induced to
      undergo lytic reactivation. We further showed that phosphorylation of Sp1 at the 
      serine-101 residue is essential in promoting the accretion of EBV replication
      proteins at the replication compartment, which is crucial for replication of
      viral DNA. Knockdown of Sp1 expression by siRNA effectively suppressed the
      replication of viral DNA and localization of EBV replication proteins to the
      replication compartments. Our study supports an important role of ATM activation 
      in lytic reactivation of EBV in epithelial cells, and phosphorylation of Sp1 is
      an essential process downstream of ATM activation involved in the formation of
      viral replication compartments. Our study revealed an essential role of the
      ATM-dependent DDR pathway in lytic reactivation of EBV, suggesting a potential
      antiviral replication strategy using specific DDR inhibitors. IMPORTANCE:
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is closely associated with human malignancies, including
      undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which has a high prevalence in
      southern China. EBV can establish either latent or lytic infection depending on
      the cellular context of infected host cells. Recent studies have highlighted the 
      importance of the DNA damage response (DDR), a surveillance mechanism that
      evolves to maintain genome integrity, in regulating lytic EBV replication.
      However, the underlying molecular events are largely undefined. ATM is
      consistently activated in EBV-infected epithelial cells when they are induced to 
      undergo lytic reactivation. Suppression of ATM inhibits replication of viral DNA.
      Furthermore, we observed that phosphorylation of Sp1 at the serine-101 residue, a
      downstream event of ATM activation, plays an essential role in the formation of
      viral replication compartments for replication of virus DNA. Our study provides
      new insights into the mechanism through which EBV utilizes the host cell
      machinery to promote replication of viral DNA upon lytic reactivation.

AB  - Replication of the human papillomavirus (HPV) double-stranded DNA genome in the
      nucleus of infected cells relies on the viral proteins E1 and E2 in conjunction
      with the host DNA replication machinery. This process is tightly linked to the
      replication of cellular DNA, in part through the cyclin-dependent phosphorylation
      of E1, which inhibits its export out of the nucleus to promote its accumulation
      in this compartment during S-phase. It has been recently shown that accumulation 
      of E1 in the nucleus, while a prerequisite for viral DNA replication, leads to
      the inhibition of cellular proliferation and the activation of a DNA damage
      response (DDR). Here we describe methods to monitor the subcellular localization 
      of E1 and to assess the deleterious effects of its nuclear accumulation on
      cellular proliferation, cell cycle progression and the induction of a DDR, using 
      a combination of colony formation assays, immunofluorescence microcopy, and flow 
      cytometry approaches.

TI  - Insight into the mechanism of inhibition of adeno-associated virus by the
      Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex.
PG  - 181-94
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01990-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a dependent virus of the family
      Parvoviridae. The gene expression and replication of AAV and derived recombinant 
      AAV (rAAV) vectors are severely limited (>10-fold) by the cellular DNA
      damage-sensing complex made up of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 (MRN). The AAV genome
      does not encode the means to circumvent this block to productive infection but
      relies on coinfecting helper virus to do so. Using adenovirus helper proteins
      E1B55k and E4orf6, which enhance the transduction of AAV via degradation of MRN, 
      we investigated the mechanism through which this DNA damage complex inhibits gene
      expression from rAAV. We tested the substrate specificity of inhibition and the
      contribution of different functions of the MRN complex. Our results demonstrate
      that both single- and double-stranded rAAV vectors are inhibited by MRN, which is
      in contrast to the predominant model that inhibition is the result of a block to 
      second-strand synthesis. Exploring the contribution of known functions of MRN, we
      found that inhibition of rAAV does not require downstream DNA damage response
      factors, including signaling kinases ATM and ATR. The nuclease domain of Mre11
      appears to play only a minor role in inhibition, while the DNA binding domain
      makes a greater contribution. Additionally, mutation of the inverted terminal
      repeat of the rAAV genome, which has been proposed to be the signal for
      interaction with MRN, is tolerated by the mechanism of inhibition. These results 
      articulate a model of inhibition of gene expression in which physical interaction
      is more important than enzymatic activity and several key downstream damage
      repair factors are dispensable. IMPORTANCE: Many viruses modulate the host DNA
      damage response (DDR) in order to create a cellular environment permissive for
      infection. The MRN complex is a primary sensor of damage in the cell but also
      responds to invading viral genomes, often posing a block to infection. AAV is
      greatly inhibited by MRN and dependent on coinfecting helper virus, such as
      adenovirus, to remove this factor. Currently, the mechanism through which MRN
      inhibits AAV and other viruses is poorly understood. Our results reform the
      predominant model that inhibition of rAAV by MRN is due to limiting second-strand
      DNA synthesis. Instead, a novel mechanism of inhibition of gene expression
      independent of a block in rAAV DNA synthesis or downstream damage factors is
      indicated. These findings have clear implications for understanding this
      restriction to transduction of AAV and rAAV vectors, which have high therapeutic 
      relevance and likely translate to other viruses that must navigate the DDR.

AB  - Rapid assembly of DNA damage response (DDR) proteins at nuclear "repair" foci is 
      a hallmark response of ionizing radiation (IR)-treated cells. The ubiquitin E3
      ligases RNF8 and RNF168 are critical for foci formation, and here we aim to
      determine their dynamic mobility and abundance at individual foci in living
      cells. To this end, YFP-tagged RNF8 and RNF168 were expressed at physiological
      levels in MCF-7 cells, then analyzed by fluorescence recovery after
      photobleaching (FRAP) assays, nuclear retention measurement, and virus-like
      particles (VLPs)-based quantification. The results showed that RNF8 and RNF168
      were both highly dynamic at IR-induced foci. Intriguingly, RNF8 displayed
      remarkably faster in vivo association/dissociation rates than RNF168, and
      RNF8-positive IR-foci were less resistant to detergent extraction. In addition,
      copy number assay revealed that RNF168 was two-fold more abundant than RNF8 at
      foci. Collectively, we show for the first time that RNF8 moves on-and-off nuclear
      DNA repair foci more than six-fold as quickly as RNF168. The faster kinetics of
      RNF8 recruitment explains why RNF8 is generally observed at DNA-breaks prior to
      RNF168. Moreover, our finding that RNF8 is less abundant than RNF168 identifies
      RNF8 as a rate-limiting determinant of focal repair complex assembly.

AB  - Picornaviridae is one of the most diverse families of viruses infecting
      vertebrate species. In contrast to the relative small number of mammal species
      compared to other vertebrates, the abundance of mammal-infecting picornaviruses
      was significantly overrepresented among the presently known picornaviruses.
      Therefore most of the current knowledge about the genome diversity/organization
      patterns and common genome features were based on the analysis of
      mammal-infecting picornaviruses. Beside the well known reservoir role of birds in
      case of several emerging viral pathogens, little is known about the diversity of 
      picornaviruses circulating among birds, although in the last decade the number of
      known avian picornavirus species with complete genome was increased from one to
      at least 15. However, little is known about the geographic distribution, host
      spectrum or pathogenic potential of the recently described picornaviruses of
      birds. Despite the low number of known avian picornaviruses, the phylogenetic and
      genome organization diversity of these viruses were remarkable. Beside the common
      L-4-3-4 and 4-3-4 genome layouts unusual genome patterns (3-4-4; 3-5-4, 3-6-4;
      3-8-4) with variable, multicistronic 2A genome regions were found among avian
      picornaviruses. The phylogenetic and genomic analysis revealed the presence of
      several conserved structures at the untranslated regions among phylogenetically
      distant avian and non-avian picornaviruses as well as at least five different
      avian picornavirus phylogenetic clusters located in every main picornavirus
      lineage with characteristic genome layouts which suggests the complex evolution
      history of these viruses. Based on the remarkable genetic diversity of the few
      known avian picornaviruses, the emergence of further divergent picornaviruses
      causing challenges in the current taxonomy and also in the understanding of the
      evolution and genome organization of picornaviruses will be strongly expected. In
      this review we would like to summarize the current knowledge about the taxonomy, 
      pathogenic potential, phylogenetic/genomic diversity and evolutional relationship
      of avian picornaviruses.

TI  - Bacterial contamination of blood components: Norwegian strategies in identifying 
      donors with higher risk of inducing septic transfusion reactions in recipients.

AB  - Bacterial contamination of blood and its cellular components remains the most
      common microbiological cause of transfusion associated morbidity and mortality,
      even in developed countries. This yet unresolved complication is seen more often 
      in platelet transfusions, as platelet concentrates are stored at room
      temperature, in gas permeable containers with constant agitation, which support
      bacterial proliferation from relatively low undetectable levels, at the beginning
      of storage time, to relatively high virulent bacteria titers and endotoxin
      generation, at the end of shelf life. Accordingly, several combined strategies
      are introduced and implemented to at least reduce the potential risk of bacterial
      contaminated products for transfusion. These embody: improved donors arms
      cleaning; bacterial avoidance by diversion of the first portion of collection;
      reducing bacterial growth through development of newer storage media for longer
      platelet shelf life; bacterial load reduction by leucoreduction/viral
      inactivation, in some countries and eliminating the use potentially contaminated 
      units through screening, through current available testing procedures, though
      none are not yet fully secure. We have not seen the same reduction in bacterial
      associated transfusion infections as we have observed for the sharp drop in
      transfusion associated transmission rates of HIV and hepatitis B and C. This
      great viral reduction is not only caused by the introduction of newer and more
      sensitive and specific detection methods for different viruses, but also the
      identification of donor risk groups through questionnaires and personal
      interviews. While search for more efficient methods for identifying potential
      blood donors with asymptomatic bacteremia, as well as a better way for detecting 
      bacteria in stored blood components will be continuing, it is necessary to
      establish more standardized guidelines for the recognition the adverse reactions 
      in recipients of potentially contaminated units. Efforts also should be also
      directed to identify blood donors with significant risk of bacteremia, at the
      time of donation in the first place as a high priority. The goal of this review
      is to highlights strategies for identifying both the sources of bacterial
      contamination of blood components in Norway and identifying donors with a higher 
      risk of bacteremia at the time of donation. The key to achieving this goal is
      initiating continual revising and upgrading the Norwegian transfusion guidelines,
      based on the transfusion legislation and by introducing a relevant specialized
      donor bacterial questionnaire.

      NF-kappaB signaling.
PG  - 1920-34
AB  - The prevalence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and high-risk human papilloma virus
      (HPV) infections in patients with oral cancer in Okinawa, southwest islands of
      Japan, has led to the hypothesis that carcinogenesis is related to EBV and HPV
      co-infection. To explore the mechanisms of transformation induced by EBV and HPV 
      co-infection, we analyzed the transformation of primary mouse embryonic
      fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing EBV and HPV-16 genes, alone or in combination.
      Expression of EBV latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) alone or in combination with 
      HPV-16 E6 increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis, whereas single
      expression of EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1), or HPV-16 E6 did not. Co-expression
      of LMP-1 and E6 induced anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in nude 
      mice, whereas expression of LMP-1 alone did not. Although the singular expression
      of these viral genes showed increased DNA damage and DNA damage response (DDR),
      co-expression of LMP-1 and E6 did not induce DDR, which is frequently seen in
      cancer cells. Furthermore, co-expression of LMP-1 with E6 increased NF-kappaB
      signaling, and the knockdown of LMP-1 or E6 in co-expressing cells decreased cell
      proliferation, anchorage independent growth, and NF-kappaB activation. These data
      suggested that expression of individual viral genes is insufficient for inducing 
      transformation and that co-expression of LMP-1 and E6, which is associated with
      suppression of DDR and increased NF-kappaB activity, lead to transformation. Our 
      findings demonstrate the synergistic effect by the interaction of oncogenes from 
      different viruses on the transformation of primary MEFs.

TI  - The ATR signaling pathway is disabled during infection with the parvovirus minute
      virus of mice.
PG  - 10189-99
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01412-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The ATR kinase has essential functions in maintenance of genome
      integrity in response to replication stress. ATR is recruited to RPA-coated
      single-stranded DNA at DNA damage sites via its interacting partner, ATRIP, which
      binds to the large subunit of RPA. ATR activation typically leads to activation
      of the Chk1 kinase among other substrates. We show here that, together with a
      number of other DNA repair proteins, both ATR and its associated protein, ATRIP, 
      were recruited to viral nuclear replication compartments (autonomous
      parvovirus-associated replication [APAR] bodies) during replication of the
      single-stranded parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM). Chk1, however, was not
      activated during MVM infection even though viral genomes bearing bound RPA,
      normally a potent trigger of ATR activation, accumulate in APAR bodies. Failure
      to activate Chk1 in response to MVM infection was likely due to our observation
      that Rad9 failed to associate with chromatin at MVM APAR bodies. Additionally,
      early in infection, prior to the onset of the virus-induced DNA damage response
      (DDR), stalling of the replication of MVM genomes with hydroxyurea (HU) resulted 
      in Chk1 phosphorylation in a virus dose-dependent manner. However, upon
      establishment of full viral replication, MVM infection prevented activation of
      Chk1 in response to HU and various other drug treatments. Finally, ATR
      phosphorylation became undetectable upon MVM infection, and although virus
      infection induced RPA32 phosphorylation on serine 33, an ATR-associated
      phosphorylation site, this phosphorylation event could not be prevented by ATR
      depletion or inhibition. Together our results suggest that MVM infection disables
      the ATR signaling pathway. IMPORTANCE: Upon infection, the parvovirus MVM
      activates a cellular DNA damage response that governs virus-induced cell cycle
      arrest and is required for efficient virus replication. ATM and ATR are major
      cellular kinases that coordinate the DNA damage response to diverse DNA damage
      stimuli. Although a significant amount has been discovered about ATM activation
      during parvovirus infection, involvement of the ATR pathway has been less
      studied. During MVM infection, Chk1, a major downstream target of ATR, is not
      detectably phosphorylated even though viral genomes bearing the bound cellular
      single-strand binding protein RPA, normally a potent trigger of ATR activation,
      accumulate in viral replication centers. ATR phosphorylation also became
      undetectable. In addition, upon establishment of full viral replication, MVM
      infection prevented activation of Chk1 in response to hydroxyurea and various
      other drug treatments. Our results suggest that MVM infection disables this
      important cellular signaling pathway.

TI  - Structure of the herpes simplex virus 1 genome: manipulation of nicks and gaps
      can abrogate infectivity and alter the cellular DNA damage response.
PG  - 10146-56
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01723-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) virion DNA contains nicks and
      gaps, and in this study a novel assay for estimating the size and number of gaps 
      in virion DNA was developed. Consistent with previous reports, we estimate that
      there are approximately 15 gaps per genome, and we calculate the average gap
      length to be approximately 30 bases. Virion DNA was isolated and treated with
      DNA-modifying enzymes in order to fill in the gaps and modify the ends.
      Interestingly, filling in gaps, blunting the ends, or adding random sequences to 
      the 3' ends of DNA, producing 3' flaps, did not impair the infectivity of treated
      DNA following transfection of Vero cells. On the other hand, the formation of 5' 
      flaps in the DNA following treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction (95 to
      100%) in infectivity. Virion DNA stimulated DNA-PKcs activity in transfected
      cells, and DNA with 5' flaps stimulated a higher level of DNA-PKcs activity than 
      that observed in cells transfected with untreated virion DNA. The infectivity of 
      5'-flapped DNA was restored in cells that do not express DNA-PKcs and in cells
      cotransfected with the immediate early protein ICP0, which degrades DNA-PKcs.
      These results are consistent with previous reports that DNA-dependent protein
      kinase (DNA-PK) and the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway are
      intrinsically antiviral and that ICP0 can counteract this effect. We suggest that
      HSV-1 DNA with 5' flaps may induce an antiviral state due to the induction of a
      DNA damage response, primarily mediated by NHEJ, that renders the HSV-1 genome
      less efficient for lytic infection. IMPORTANCE: For productive lytic infection to
      occur, HSV-1 must counteract a variety of cellular intrinsic antiviral
      mechanisms, including the DNA damage response (DDR). DDR pathways have been
      associated with silencing of gene expression, cell cycle arrest, and induction of
      apoptosis. In addition, the fate of viral genomes is likely to play a role in
      whether viral genomes adopt a configuration suitable for lytic DNA replication.
      This study demonstrates that virion DNA activates the cellular DDR kinase,
      DNA-PK, and that this response is inhibitory to viral infection. Furthermore, we 
      show that HSV-1 ubiquitin ligase, ICP0, plays an important role in counteracting 
      the negative effects of DNA-PK activation. These findings support the notion that
      DNA-PK is antiviral and suggest that the fate of incoming viral DNA has important
      consequences for the progression of lytic infection. This study underscores the
      complex evolutionary relationships between HSV and its host.

AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that cancer cell stress induced by chemotherapeutic
      agents promote antitumor immune responses and contribute to their full clinical
      efficacy. In this article, we identify the signaling events underlying
      chemotherapy-induced NKG2D and DNAM-1 ligand expression on multiple myeloma (MM) 
      cells. Our findings indicate that sublethal doses of doxorubicin and melphalan
      initiate a DNA damage response (DDR) controlling ligand upregulation on MM cell
      lines and patient-derived malignant plasma cells in Chk1/2-dependent and
      p53-independent manner. Drug-induced MICA and PVR gene expression are
      transcriptionally regulated and involve DDR-dependent E2F1 transcription factor
      activity. We also describe the involvement of changes in the redox state in the
      control of DDR-dependent upregulation of ligand surface expression and gene
      transcriptional activity by using the antioxidant agent N-acetyl-L-cysteine.
      Finally, in accordance with much evidence indicating that DDR and oxidative
      stress are major determinants of cellular senescence, we found that
      redox-dependent DDR activation upon chemotherapeutic treatment is critical for MM
      cell entry in premature senescence and is required for the preferential ligand
      upregulation on senescent cells, which are preferentially killed by NK cells and 
      trigger potent IFN-gamma production. We propose immunogenic senescence as a
      mechanism that promotes the clearance of drug-treated tumor cells by innate
      effector lymphocytes, including NK cells.

PG  - 153867
LID - 10.1155/2014/153867 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been known as one of the most lethal human
      malignancies, due to the difficulty of early detection, chemoresistance, and
      radioresistance, and is characterized by active angiogenesis and metastasis,
      which account for rapid recurrence and poor survival. Its development has been
      closely associated with multiple risk factors, including hepatitis B and C virus 
      infection, alcohol consumption, obesity, and diet contamination. Genetic
      alterations and genomic instability, probably resulted from unrepaired DNA
      lesions, are increasingly recognized as a common feature of human HCC.
      Dysregulation of DNA damage repair and signaling to cell cycle checkpoints, known
      as the DNA damage response (DDR), is associated with a predisposition to cancer
      and affects responses to DNA-damaging anticancer therapy. It has been
      demonstrated that various HCC-associated risk factors are able to promote DNA
      damages, formation of DNA adducts, and chromosomal aberrations. Hence,
      alterations in the DDR pathways may accumulate these lesions to trigger
      hepatocarcinogenesis and also to facilitate advanced HCC progression. This review
      collects some of the most known information about the link between HCC-associated
      risk factors and DDR pathways in HCC. Hopefully, the review will remind the
      researchers and clinicians of further characterizing and validating the roles of 
      these DDR pathways in HCC.

AB  - Viruses use different strategies to overcome the host defense system. Recent
      studies have shown that viruses can induce DNA damage response (DDR). Many of
      these viruses use DDR signaling to benefit their replication, while other viruses
      block or inactivate DDR signaling. This review focuses on the effects of DDR and 
      DNA repair on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication. Here, we review the DDR
      induced by HCMV infection and its similarities and differences to DDR induced by 
      other viruses. As DDR signaling pathways are critical for the replication of many
      viruses, blocking these pathways may represent novel therapeutic opportunities
      for the treatment of certain infectious diseases. Lastly, future perspectives in 
      the field are discussed.

TI  - Productive replication of human papillomavirus 31 requires DNA repair factor
      Nbs1.
PG  - 8528-44
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00517-14 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Activation of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated
      kinase)-dependent DNA damage response (DDR) is necessary for productive
      replication of human papillomavirus 31 (HPV31). We previously found that DNA
      repair and homologous recombination (HR) factors localize to sites of HPV
      replication, suggesting that ATM activity is required to recruit factors to viral
      genomes that can productively replicate viral DNA in a recombination-dependent
      manner. The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex is an essential component of the DDR
      that is necessary for ATM-mediated HR repair and localizes to HPV DNA foci. In
      this study, we demonstrate that the HPV E7 protein is sufficient to increase
      levels of the MRN complex and also interacts with MRN components. We have found
      that Nbs1 depletion blocks productive viral replication and results in decreased 
      localization of Mre11, Rad50, and the principal HR factor Rad51 to HPV DNA foci
      upon differentiation. Nbs1 contributes to the DDR by acting as an upstream
      activator of ATM in response to double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and as a
      downstream effector of ATM activity in the intra-S-phase checkpoint. We have
      found that phosphorylation of ATM and its downstream target Chk2, as well as SMC1
      (structural maintenance of chromosome 1), is maintained upon Nbs1 knockdown in
      differentiating cells. Given that ATM and Chk2 are required for productive
      replication, our results suggest that Nbs1 contributes to viral replication
      outside its role as an ATM activator, potentially through ensuring localization
      of DNA repair factors to viral genomes that are necessary for efficient
      productive replication. IMPORTANCE: The mechanisms that regulate human
      papillomavirus (HPV) replication during the viral life cycle are not well
      understood. Our finding that Nbs1 is necessary for productive replication even in
      the presence of ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase) and Chk2
      phosphorylation offers evidence that Nbs1 contributes to viral replication
      downstream of facilitating ATM activation. Nbs1 is required for the recruitment
      of Mre11 and Rad50 to viral genomes, suggesting that the MRN complex plays a
      direct role in facilitating productive viral replication, potentially through the
      processing of substrates that are recognized by the key homologous recombination 
      (HR) factor Rad51. The discovery that E7 increases levels of MRN components, and 
      MRN complex formation, identifies a novel role for E7 in facilitating productive 
      replication. Our study not only identifies DNA repair factors necessary for HPV
      replication but also provides a deeper understanding of how HPV utilizes the DNA 
      damage response to regulate viral replication.

TI  - Simian virus 40 large T antigen induces IFN-stimulated genes through ATR kinase.
PG  - 5933-42
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1303470 [doi]
AB  - Polyomaviruses encode a large T Ag (LT), a multifunctional protein essential for 
      the regulation of both viral and host cell gene expression and productive viral
      infection. Previously, we have shown that stable expression of LT protein results
      in upregulation of genes involved in the IFN induction and signaling pathway. In 
      this study, we focus on the cellular signaling mechanism that leads to the
      induction of IFN responses by LT. Our results show that ectopic expression of
      SV40 LT results in the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in human
      fibroblasts and confers an antiviral state. We describe a LT-initiated DNA damage
      response (DDR) that activates IFN regulatory factor 1, causing IFN-beta
      production and consequent ISG expression in human cells. This IFN-beta and ISG
      induction is dependent on ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR)
      kinase, but independent of ATM. ATR kinase inhibition using a selective kinase
      inhibitor (ETP-46464) caused a decrease in IFN regulatory factor 1 stabilization 
      and ISG expression. Furthermore, expression of a mutant LT that does not induce
      DDR also does not induce IFN-beta and ISGs. These results show that, in the
      absence of viral infection, LT-initiated activation of ATR-dependent DDR is
      sufficient for the induction of an IFN-beta-mediated innate immune response in
      human cells. Thus, we have uncovered a novel and critical role for ATR as a
      mediator of antiviral responses utilizing LT.

TI  - STAT3 interrupts ATR-Chk1 signaling to allow oncovirus-mediated cell
      proliferation.
PG  - 4946-51
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1400683111 [doi]
AB  - DNA damage response (DDR) is a signaling network that senses DNA damage and
      activates response pathways to coordinate cell-cycle progression and DNA repair. 
      Thus, DDR is critical for maintenance of genome stability, and presents a
      powerful defense against tumorigenesis. Therefore, to drive cell-proliferation
      and transformation, viral and cellular oncogenes need to circumvent DDR-induced
      cell-cycle checkpoints. Unlike in hereditary cancers, mechanisms that attenuate
      DDR and disrupt cell-cycle checkpoints in sporadic cancers are not well
      understood. Using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as a source of oncogenes, we have
      previously shown that EBV-driven cell proliferation requires the cellular
      transcription factor STAT3. EBV infection is rapidly followed by activation and
      increased expression of STAT3, which mediates relaxation of the intra-S phase
      cell-cycle checkpoint; this facilitates viral oncogene-driven cell proliferation.
      We now show that replication stress-associated DNA damage, which results from EBV
      infection, is detected by DDR. However, signaling downstream of ATR is impaired
      by STAT3, leading to relaxation of the intra-S phase checkpoint. We find that
      STAT3 interrupts ATR-to-Chk1 signaling by promoting loss of Claspin, a protein
      that assists ATR to phosphorylate Chk1. This loss of Claspin which ultimately
      facilitates cell proliferation is mediated by caspase 7, a protein that typically
      promotes cell death. Our findings demonstrate how STAT3, which is constitutively 
      active in many human cancers, suppresses DDR, fundamental to tumorigenesis. This 
      newly recognized role for STAT3 in attenuation of DDR, discovered in the context 
      of EBV infection, is of broad interest as the biology of cell proliferation is
      central to both health and disease.

TI  - Mitogen-induced B-cell proliferation activates Chk2-dependent G1/S cell cycle
      arrest.
PG  - e87299
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0087299 [doi]
AB  - B-cell activation and proliferation can be induced by a variety of extracellular 
      stimuli. The fate of an activated B cell following mitogen stimulation can be
      dictated by the strength or duration of the signal, the expression of downstream 
      signaling components necessary to promote proliferation, and the cell intrinsic
      sensors and regulators of the proliferative program. Previously we have
      identified the DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathway as a cell intrinsic
      sensor that is activated upon latent infection of primary human B cells by
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Here we have assessed the role of the DDR as a limiting
      factor in the proliferative response to non-viral B-cell mitogens. We report that
      TLR9 activation through CpG-rich oligonucleotides induced B-cell
      hyper-proliferation and an ATM/Chk2 downstream signaling pathway. However, B-cell
      activation through the CD40 pathway coupled with interleukin-4 (IL-4) promoted
      proliferation less robustly and only a modest DDR. These two mitogens, but not
      EBV, modestly induced intrinsic apoptosis that was independent from the DDR.
      However, all three mitogens triggered a DDR-dependent G1/S phase cell cycle
      arrest preventing B-cell proliferation. The extent of G1/S arrest, as evidenced
      by release through Chk2 inhibition, correlated with B-cell proliferation rates.
      These findings have implications for the regulation of extra-follicular B-cell
      activation as it may pertain to the development of auto-immune diseases or
      lymphoma.

TI  - Parvovirus-induced depletion of cyclin B1 prevents mitotic entry of infected
      cells.
PG  - e1003891
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003891 [doi]
AB  - Parvoviruses halt cell cycle progression following initiation of their
      replication during S-phase and continue to replicate their genomes for extended
      periods of time in arrested cells. The parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM)
      induces a DNA damage response that is required for viral replication and
      induction of the S/G2 cell cycle block. However, p21 and Chk1, major effectors
      typically associated with S-phase and G2-phase cell cycle arrest in response to
      diverse DNA damage stimuli, are either down-regulated, or inactivated,
      respectively, during MVM infection. This suggested that parvoviruses can modulate
      cell cycle progression by another mechanism. In this work we show that the
      MVM-induced, p21- and Chk1-independent, cell cycle block proceeds via a two-step 
      process unlike that seen in response to other DNA-damaging agents or virus
      infections. MVM infection induced Chk2 activation early in infection which led to
      a transient S-phase block associated with proteasome-mediated CDC25A degradation.
      This step was necessary for efficient viral replication; however, Chk2 activation
      and CDC25A loss were not sufficient to keep infected cells in the sustained
      G2-arrested state which characterizes this infection. Rather, although the
      phosphorylation of CDK1 that normally inhibits entry into mitosis was lost, the
      MVM induced DDR resulted first in a targeted mis-localization and then
      significant depletion of cyclin B1, thus directly inhibiting cyclin B1-CDK1
      complex function and preventing mitotic entry. MVM infection thus uses a novel
      strategy to ensure a pseudo S-phase, pre-mitotic, nuclear environment for
      sustained viral replication.

AB  - In general, the interplay among viruses and DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways can 
      be divided based on whether the interaction promotes or inhibits the viral
      lifecycle. The propagation of human papillomaviruses is both promoted and
      inhibited by DDR proteins. As a result, HPV proteins both activate repair
      pathways, such as the ATM and ATR pathways, and inhibit other pathways, most
      notably the p53 signaling pathway. Indeed, the role of HPV proteins, with regard 
      to the DDR pathways, can be divided into two broad categories. The first set of
      viral proteins, HPV E1 and E2 activate a DNA damage response and recruit repair
      proteins to viral replication centers, where these proteins are likely usurped to
      replicate the viral genome. Because the activation of the DDR response typically 
      elicits a cell cycle arrest that would impeded the viral lifecycle, the second
      set of HPV proteins, HPV E6 and E7, prevents the DDR response from pausing cell
      cycle progression or inducing apoptosis. This review provides a detailed account 
      of the interactions among HPV proteins and DDR proteins that facilitate HPV
      propagation.

      replication sites to support efficient viral DNA replication.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Accumulating evidence indicates a role for Merkel cell polyomavirus
      (MCPyV) in the development of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), making MCPyV the first
      polyomavirus to be clearly associated with human cancer. With the high prevalence
      of MCPyV infection and the increasing amount of MCC diagnosis, there is a need to
      better understand the virus and its oncogenic potential. In this study, we
      examined the relationship between the host DNA damage response (DDR) and MCPyV
      replication. We found that components of the ATM- and ATR-mediated DDR pathways
      accumulate in MCPyV large T antigen (LT)-positive nuclear foci in cells infected 
      with native MCPyV virions. To further study MCPyV replication, we employed our
      previously established system, in which recombinant MCPyV episomal DNA is
      autonomously replicated in cultured cells. Similar to native MCPyV infection,
      where both MCPyV origin and LT are present, the host DDR machinery colocalized
      with LT in distinct nuclear foci. Immunofluorescence in situ hybridization and
      bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation analysis showed that these DDR proteins
      and MCPyV LT in fact colocalized at the actively replicating MCPyV replication
      complexes, which were absent when a replication-defective LT mutant or an
      MCPyV-origin mutant was introduced in place of wild-type LT or wild-type viral
      origin. Inhibition of DDR kinases using chemical inhibitors and ATR/ATM small
      interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown reduced MCPyV DNA replication without
      significantly affecting LT expression or the host cell cycle. This study
      demonstrates that these host DDR factors are important for MCPyV DNA replication,
      providing new insight into the host machinery involved in the MCPyV life cycle.
      IMPORTANCE: MCPyV is the first polyomavirus to be clearly associated with human
      cancer. However, the MCPyV life cycle and its oncogenic mechanism remain poorly
      understood. In this report, we show that, in cells infected with native MCPyV
      virions, components of the ATM- and ATR-mediated DDR pathways accumulate in MCPyV
      LT-positive nuclear foci. Such a phenotype was recapitulated using our previously
      established system for visualizing MCPyV replication complexes in cells. By
      combining immunofluorescent staining, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and
      BrdU incorporation analysis, we demonstrate that DDR proteins are important for
      maintaining robust MCPyV DNA replication. This study not only provides the first 
      look into the microscopic details of DDR factor/LT replication complexes at the
      MCPyV origin but also provides a platform for further studying the mechanistic
      role of host DDR factors in the MCPyV life cycle and virus-associated
      oncogenesis.

TI  - Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus induces the ATM and H2AX DNA damage
      response early during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells, which play 
      roles in latency establishment.
PG  - 2821-34
LID - 10.1128/JVI.03126-13 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The DNA damage response (DDR) that evolved to repair host cell DNA
      damage also recognizes viral DNA entering the nucleus during infections. Here, we
      investigated the modulation of DDR signaling during de novo infection of primary 
      endothelial cells by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).
      Phosphorylation of representative DDR-associated proteins, such as ataxia
      telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and H2AX, was induced as early as 30 min (0.5 h)
      postinfection and persisted during in vitro KSHV latency. Phosphorylated H2AX
      (gammaH2AX) colocalized at 30 min (0.5 h) with the KSHV genome entering the
      nuclei. Total H2AX protein levels also increased, and the increase was attributed
      to a decrease in degradative H2AX Lys48-linked polyubiquitination with a
      concomitant increase in Lys63-linked polyubiquitination that was shown to
      increase protein stability. ATM and H2AX phosphorylation and gammaH2AX nuclear
      foci were also induced by UV-inactivated KSHV, which ceased at later times of
      infection. Inhibition of ATM kinase activity by KU-55933 and H2AX knockdown by
      small interfering RNA significantly reduced the expression of the KSHV
      latency-associated nuclear antigen 1 (LANA-1; ORF73) and LANA-1 nuclear puncta.
      Knockdown of H2AX also resulted in a >80% reduction in the nuclear KSHV DNA copy 
      numbers. Similar results were also observed in ATM-negative cells, although
      comparable levels of viral DNA entered ATM-negative and ATM-positive cell nuclei.
      In contrast, knockdown of CHK1 and CHK2 did not affect ORF73 expression.
      Collectively, these results demonstrate that KSHV induces ATM and H2AX, a
      selective arm of the DDR, for the establishment and maintenance of its latency
      during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells. IMPORTANCE: Eukaryotic
      cells mount a DNA damage response (DDR) to sense and repair different types of
      cellular DNA damage. In addition, DDR also recognizes exogenous genetic material,
      such as the viral DNA genome entering the nucleus during infections. The present 
      study was undertaken to determine whether de novo Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
      herpesvirus (KSHV) infection modulates DDR. Our results demonstrate that early
      during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells, KSHV induces a selective
      arm of DDR signaling, such as the ATM kinase and its downstream target, H2AX,
      which are essential for KSHV's latent gene expression and the establishment of
      latency. These studies suggest that targeting ATM and H2AX could serve as an
      attractive strategy to block the establishment of KSHV latent infection and the
      associated malignancies.

AB  - Emerging evidence confirms that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for the 
      chemoradioresistance of malignancies. EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1
      (LMP1) is associated with tumor relapse and poor prognosis of nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma (NPC). However, whether LMP1 induces the development of CSCs and the
      mechanism by which this rare cell subpopulation leads to radioresistance in NPC
      remain unclear. In the present study, LMP1-transformed NPC cells showed
      significant radioresistance compared to the empty vector control. We found that
      LMP1 up-regulated the expression of several stemness-related genes, increased the
      cell number of side population (SP) by flow cytometry analysis, enhanced the
      self-renewal properties of the cells in a spherical culture and enhanced the in
      vivo tumor initiation ability. We also found that LMP1 positively regulated the
      expression of the CSC marker CD44. The CD44(+/High) subpopulation of the
      LMP1-transformed NPC cells displayed more significant CSC characteristics than
      the CD44(-/Low) subpopulation of the LMP1-transformed NPC cells; these
      characteristics included the upregulation of stemness-related genes, in vitro
      self-renewal and in vivo tumor initiation ability. Importantly, the CD44(+/High) 
      subpopulation displayed more radioresistance than the CD44(-/Low) subpopulation. 
      Our results also demonstrated that phosphorylation of the DNA damage response
      (DDR) proteins, ATM, Chk1, Chk2 and p53, was inactivated in the LMP1-induced
      CD44(+/High) cells in response to DNA damage, and this was accompanied by a
      downregulation of the p53-targeted proapoptotic genes, which suggested that the
      inactivation of the p53-mediated apoptosis pathway was responsible for the
      radioresistance in the CD44(+/High) cells. Taken together, we found that LMP1
      induced an increase in CSC-like CD44(+/High) cells, and we determined the
      molecular mechanism underlying the radioresistance of the LMP1-activated CSCs,
      highlighting the need of CSC-targeted radiotherapy in EBV-positive NPC.

AB  - DNA damage response (DDR) genes and pathways controlling the stability of HPV
      episomal DNA are reported here. We set out to understand the mechanism by which a
      DNA-binding, N-methylpyrrole-imidazole hairpin polyamide (PA25) acts to cause the
      dramatic loss of HPV DNA from cells. Southern blots revealed that PA25 alters HPV
      episomes within 5 hours of treatment. Gene expression arrays identified numerous 
      DDR genes that were specifically altered in HPV16 episome-containing cells (W12E)
      by PA25, but not in HPV-negative (C33A) cells or in cells with integrated HPV16
      (SiHa). A siRNA screen of 240 DDR genes was then conducted to identify enhancers 
      and repressors of PA25 activity. Serendipitously, the screen also identified many
      novel genes, such as TDP1 and TDP2, regulating normal HPV episome stability. MRN 
      and 9-1-1 complexes emerged as important for PA25-mediated episome destruction
      and were selected for follow-up studies. Mre11, along with other homologous
      recombination and dsDNA break repair genes, was among the highly significant PA25
      repressors. The Mre11 inhibitor Mirin was found to sensitize HPV episomes to PA25
      resulting in a approximately 5-fold reduction of the PA25 IC50. A novel assay
      that couples end-labeling of DNA to Q-PCR showed that PA25 causes strand breaks
      within HPV DNA, and that Mirin greatly enhances this activity. The 9-1-1 complex 
      member Rad9, a representative PA25 enhancer, was transiently phosphorylated in
      response to PA25 treatment suggesting that it has a role in detecting and
      signaling episome damage by PA25 to the cell. These results establish that
      DNA-targeted compounds enter cells and specifically target the HPV episome. This 
      action leads to the activation of numerous DDR pathways and the massive
      elimination of episomal DNA from cells. Our findings demonstrate that viral
      episomes can be targeted for elimination from cells by minor groove binding
      agents, and implicate DDR pathways as important mediators of this process.

TI  - Replication stress and mitotic dysfunction in cells expressing simian virus 40
      large T antigen.
PG  - 13179-92
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02224-13 [doi]
AB  - We previously demonstrated that simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (LT) binds
      to the Bub1 kinase, a key regulator of the spindle checkpoint and chromosome
      segregation. Bub1 mutations or altered expression patterns are linked to
      chromosome missegregation and are considered to be a driving force in some human 
      cancers. Here we report that LT, dependent on Bub1 binding, causes micronuclei,
      lagging chromatin, and anaphase bridges, which are hallmarks of chromosomal
      instability (CIN) and Bub1 insufficiency. Using time-lapse microscopy, we
      demonstrate that LT imposes a Bub1 binding-dependent delay in the
      metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Kinetochore fibers reveal that LT, via Bub1
      binding, causes aberrant kinetochore (KT)-microtubule (MT) attachments and a
      shortened interkinetochore distance, consistent with a lack of tension.
      Previously, we showed that LT also induces the DNA damage response (DDR) via Bub1
      binding. Using inducible LT cell lines, we show that an activated DDR was
      observed before the appearance of anaphase bridges and micronuclei. Furthermore, 
      LT induction in serum-starved cells demonstrated gamma-H2AX accumulation in cells
      that had not yet entered mitosis. Thus, DDR activation can occur independently of
      chromosome segregation defects. Replication stress pathways may be responsible,
      because signatures of replication stress were observed, which were attenuated by 
      exogenous supplementation with nucleosides. Our observations allow us to propose 
      a model that explains and integrates the diverse manifestations of genomic
      instability induced by LT.

TI  - Baculovirus F-box protein LEF-7 modifies the host DNA damage response to enhance 
      virus multiplication.
PG  - 12592-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02501-13 [doi]
AB  - The DNA damage response (DDR) of a host organism represents an effective
      antiviral defense that is frequently manipulated and exploited by viruses to
      promote multiplication. We report here that the large DNA baculoviruses, which
      require host DDR activation for optimal replication, encode a conserved
      replication factor, LEF-7, that manipulates the DDR via a novel mechanism. LEF-7 
      suppresses DDR-induced accumulation of phosphorylated host histone variant H2AX
      (gamma-H2AX), a critical regulator of the DDR. LEF-7 was necessary and sufficient
      to block gamma-H2AX accumulation caused by baculovirus infection or DNA damage
      induced by means of pharmacological agents. Deletion of LEF-7 from the
      baculovirus genome allowed gamma-H2AX accumulation during virus DNA synthesis and
      impaired both very late viral gene expression and production of infectious
      progeny. Thus, LEF-7 is essential for efficient baculovirus replication. We
      determined that LEF-7 is a nuclear F-box protein that interacts with host S-phase
      kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1), suggesting that LEF-7 acts as a substrate
      recognition component of SKP1/Cullin/F-box (SCF) complexes for targeted protein
      polyubiquitination. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that LEF-7's
      N-terminal F-box is necessary for gamma-H2AX repression and Autographa
      californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) replication events. We
      concluded that LEF-7 expedites virus replication most likely by selective
      manipulation of one or more host factors regulating the DDR, including
      gamma-H2AX. Thus, our findings indicate that baculoviruses utilize a unique
      strategy among viruses for hijacking the host DDR by using a newly recognized
      F-box protein.

AB  - Multilayer preventative strategies have been instituted to enhance transfusion
      safety for patients in need of critical blood components. Presently blood safety 
      is at its highest levels, with the implementation of precautionary/preventative
      measures against vCJD, bacterial and viral contamination of the blood supply. The
      implementation of these strategies together with advances in automation and
      computerization led to significant improvements in standardisation for
      transfusion practices. These include validation, verification, adherence to GLP
      and GMP and other regulatory requirements. In most European countries, universal 
      prestorage leukodepletion is routine practice. In France proactive pathogen
      inactivation treatments [PITs] have been implemented emphasizing patient safety. 
      This at least conceptually reduces the risk of transfusing viable WBCs, emerging 
      bacteria and viruses, all with potential transfusion complications. In the UK,
      prion removal filters for red cell products are used selectively for special
      groups of patients. Some research establishments are exploring the potential
      impact of pathogen inactivation of whole blood or red cell components, using the 
      new generation of S-303 PIT and the prion removal filters in combination. It
      needs to be determined whether such a combined strategy, applied synergistically,
      enhances red cell transfusion safety without compromising the overall criteria of
      acceptability. It is necessary to critically examine the impact of a new
      generation of PIT technologies, which may exacerbate the red cell storage lesion 
      and cause the development of undesirable antibodies in the recipient. The
      development of innovative laboratory tools is vital to study impacts of these
      measures on the quality of stored blood and their clinical outcome. The ultimate 
      aim of red cell transfusion is to provide oxygen enriched red blood cells to the 
      microcirculations and tissues. Definitive studies are needed to establish the
      potential unforeseen negative long term toxicity, overall efficacy/quality and
      the clinical outcome of treated stored blood.

TI  - Merkel cell polyomavirus large T antigen disrupts host genomic integrity and
      inhibits cellular proliferation.
PG  - 9173-88
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01216-13 [doi]
AB  - Clonal integration of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) DNA into the host genome has
      been observed in at least 80% of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). The integrated
      viral genome typically carries mutations that truncate the C-terminal DNA binding
      and helicase domains of the MCV large T antigen (LT), suggesting a selective
      pressure to remove this MCV LT region during tumor development. In this study, we
      show that MCV infection leads to the activation of host DNA damage responses
      (DDR). This activity was mapped to the C-terminal helicase-containing region of
      the MCV LT. The MCV LT-activated DNA damage kinases, in turn, led to enhanced p53
      phosphorylation, upregulation of p53 downstream target genes, and cell cycle
      arrest. Compared to the N-terminal MCV LT fragment that is usually preserved in
      mutants isolated from MCC tumors, full-length MCV LT shows a decreased potential 
      to support cellular proliferation, focus formation, and anchorage-independent
      cell growth. These apparently antitumorigenic effects can be reversed by a
      dominant-negative p53 inhibitor. Our results demonstrate that MCV LT-induced DDR 
      activates p53 pathway, leading to the inhibition of cellular proliferation. This 
      study reveals a key difference between MCV LT and simian vacuolating virus 40 LT,
      which activates a DDR but inhibits p53 function. This study also explains, in
      part, why truncation mutations that remove the MCV LT C-terminal region are
      necessary for the oncogenic progression of MCV-associated cancers.

AB  - Viruses encounter many challenges within host cells in order to replicate their
      nucleic acid. In the case of DNA viruses, one challenge that must be overcome is 
      recognition of viral DNA structures by the host DNA damage response (DDR)
      machinery. This is accomplished in elegant and unique ways by different viruses
      as each has specific needs and sensitivities dependent on its life cycle. In this
      review, we focus on three DNA tumor viruses and their interactions with the DDR. 
      The viruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
      (KSHV), and human papillomavirus (HPV) account for nearly all of the
      virus-associated human cancers worldwide. These viruses have also been excellent 
      models for the study of oncogenic virus-mediated cell transformation. In this
      review, we will discuss how each of these viruses engage and subvert aspects of
      the host DDR. The first level of DDR engagement is a result of the genetic
      linkage between the oncogenic potential of these viruses and their ability to
      replicate. Namely, the promotion of cells from quiescence into the cell cycle to 
      facilitate virus replication can be sensed through aberrant cellular DNA
      replication structures which activate the DDR and hinder cell transformation. DNA
      tumor viruses subvert this growth-suppressive DDR through changes in viral
      oncoprotein expression which ultimately facilitate virus replication. An
      additional level of DDR engagement is through direct detection of replicating
      viral DNA. These interactions parallel those observed in other DNA virus systems 
      in that the need to subvert these intrinsic sensors of aberrant DNA structure in

TI  - H2AX phosphorylation is important for LANA-mediated Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
      herpesvirus episome persistence.

AB  - The DNA damage response (DDR) of host cells is utilized by a number of viruses to
      establish and propagate their genomes in the infected cells. We examined the
      expression of the DDR genes during Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)
      infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The genes were
      mostly downregulated, except H2AX, which was upregulated during infection. H2AX
      is important for gammaherpesvirus infectivity, and its phosphorylation at serine 
      139 is crucial for maintenance of latency during mouse gamma-herpesvirus 68
      (MHV-68) infection. We now also observed phosphorylation of H2AX at serine 139
      during KSHV infection. H2AX is a histone H2A isoform shown to interact with the
      latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) encoded by KSHV. Here, we show that
      LANA directly interacted with H2AX through domains at both its N and C termini.
      The phosphorylated form of H2AX (gammaH2AX) was shown to colocalize with LANA.
      Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that a reduction in H2AX
      levels resulted in reduced binding of LANA with KSHV terminal repeats (TRs).
      Binding preferences of H2AX and gammaH2AX along the KSHV episome were examined by
      whole-episome ChIP analysis. We showed that gammaH2AX had a higher relative
      binding activity along the TR regions than that of the long unique region (LUR), 
      which highlighted the importance of H2AX phosphorylation during KSHV infection.
      Furthermore, knockdown of H2AX resulted in decreased KSHV episome copy number.
      Notably, the C terminus of LANA contributed to phosphorylation of H2AX. However, 
      phosphorylation was not dependent on the ability of LANA to drive KSHV-infected
      cells into S-phase. Thus, H2AX contributes to association of LANA with the TRs,
      and phosphorylation of H2AX is likely important for its increased density at the 
      TRs.

TI  - Parvovirus infection-induced DNA damage response.
PG  - 245-257
AB  - Parvoviruses are a group of small DNA viruses with ssDNA genomes flanked by two
      inverted terminal structures. Due to a limited genetic resource they require host
      cellular factors and sometimes a helper virus for efficient viral replication.
      Recent studies have shown that parvoviruses interact with the DNA damage
      machinery, which has a significant impact on the life cycle of the virus as well 
      as the fate of infected cells. In addition, due to special DNA structures of the 
      viral genomes, parvoviruses are useful tools for the study of the molecular
      mechanisms underlying viral infection-induced DNA damage response (DDR). This
      review aims to summarize recent advances in parvovirus-induced DDR, with a focus 
      on the diverse DDR pathways triggered by different parvoviruses and the
      consequences of DDR on the viral life cycle as well as the fate of infected
      cells.

TI  - Activation of WIP1 phosphatase by HTLV-1 Tax mitigates the cellular response to
      DNA damage.
PG  - e55989
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0055989 [doi]
AB  - Genomic instability stemming from dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA
      damage response (DDR) is a common feature of many cancers. The cancer adult T
      cell leukemia (ATL) can occur in individuals infected with human T cell leukemia 
      virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and ATL cells contain extensive chromosomal abnormalities,
      suggesting that they have defects in the recognition or repair of DNA damage.
      Since Tax is the transforming protein encoded by HTLV-1, we asked whether Tax can
      affect cell cycle checkpoints and the DDR. Using a combination of flow cytometry 
      and DNA repair assays we showed that Tax-expressing cells exit G(1) phase and
      initiate DNA replication prematurely following damage. Reduced phosphorylation of
      H2AX (gammaH2AX) and RPA2, phosphoproteins that are essential to properly
      initiate the DDR, was also observed in Tax-expressing cells. To determine the
      cause of decreased DDR protein phosphorylation in Tax-expressing cells, we
      examined the cellular phosphatase, WIP1, which is known to dephosphorylate
      gammaH2AX. We found that Tax can interact with Wip1 in vivo and in vitro, and
      that Tax-expressing cells display elevated levels of Wip1 mRNA. In vitro
      phosphatase assays showed that Tax can enhance Wip1 activity on a gammaH2AX
      peptide target by 2-fold. Thus, loss of gammaH2AX in vivo could be due, in part, 
      to increased expression and activity of WIP1 in the presence of Tax. siRNA
      knockdown of WIP1 in Tax-expressing cells rescued gammaH2AX in response to
      damage, confirming the role of WIP1 in the DDR. These studies demonstrate that
      Tax can disengage the G(1)/S checkpoint by enhancing WIP1 activity, resulting in 
      reduced DDR. Premature G(1) exit of Tax-expressing cells in the presence of DNA
      lesions creates an environment that tolerates incorporation of random mutations
      into the host genome.

AB  - Studies with different viral infection models on virus interactions with the host
      cell nucleus have opened new perspectives on our understanding of the molecular
      basis of these interactions in African swine fever virus (ASFV) infection. The
      present study aims to characterize the host DNA damage response (DDR) occurring
      upon in vitro infection with the ASFV-Ba71V isolate. We evaluated protein levels 
      during ASFV time-course infection, of several signalling cascade factors
      belonging to DDR pathways involved in double strand break repair - Ataxia
      Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM), ATM-Rad 3 related (ATR) and DNA dependent protein
      kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). DDR inhibitory trials using caffeine and
      wortmannin and ATR inducible-expression cell lines were used to confirm specific 
      pathway activation during viral infection. Our results show that ASFV
      specifically elicits ATR-mediated pathway activation from the early phase of
      infection with increased levels of H2AX, RPA32, p53, ATR and Chk1 phosphorylated 
      forms. Viral p72 synthesis was abrogated by ATR kinase inhibitors and also in
      ATR-kd cells. Furthermore, a reduction of viral progeny was identified in these
      cells when compared to the outcome of infection in ATR-wt. Overall, our results
      strongly suggest that the ATR pathway plays an essential role for successful ASFV
      infection of host cells.

TI  - SMC1-mediated intra-S-phase arrest facilitates bocavirus DNA replication.
PG  - 4017-32
LID - 10.1128/JVI.03396-12 [doi]
AB  - Activation of a host DNA damage response (DDR) is essential for DNA replication
      of minute virus of canines (MVC), a member of the genus Bocavirus of the
      Parvoviridae family; however, the mechanism by which DDR contributes to viral DNA
      replication is unknown. In the current study, we demonstrate that MVC infection
      triggers the intra-S-phase arrest to slow down host cellular DNA replication and 
      to recruit cellular DNA replication factors for viral DNA replication. The
      intra-S-phase arrest is regulated by ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase)
      signaling in a p53-independent manner. Moreover, we demonstrate that SMC1
      (structural maintenance of chromosomes 1) is the key regulator of the
      intra-S-phase arrest induced during infection. Either knockdown of SMC1 or
      complementation with a dominant negative SMC1 mutant blocks both the
      intra-S-phase arrest and viral DNA replication. Finally, we show that the
      intra-S-phase arrest induced during MVC infection was caused neither by damaged
      host cellular DNA nor by viral proteins but by replicating viral genomes
      physically associated with the DNA damage sensor, the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN)
      complex. In conclusion, the feedback loop between MVC DNA replication and the
      intra-S-phase arrest is mediated by ATM-SMC1 signaling and plays a critical role 
      in MVC DNA replication. Thus, our findings unravel the mechanism underlying DDR
      signaling-facilitated MVC DNA replication and demonstrate a novel strategy of DNA
      virus-host interaction.

TI  - Human papillomavirus episome stability is reduced by aphidicolin and controlled
      by DNA damage response pathways.
PG  - 3979-89

AB  - A highly reproducible quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) assay was used to study the
      stability of human papillomavirus (HPV) in undifferentiated keratinocytes that
      maintain viral episomes. The term "stability" refers to the ability of episomes
      to persist with little copy number variation in cells. In investigating the
      mechanism of action of PA25, a previously published compound that destabilizes
      HPV episomes, aphidicolin was also found to markedly decrease episome levels, but
      via a different pathway from that of PA25. Since aphidicolin is known to activate
      DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, effects of inhibitors and small interfering
      RNAs (siRNAs) acting within DDR pathways were investigated. Inhibitors of Chk1
      and siRNA directed against ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and
      ataxia-telangiectasia Rad3-related (ATR) pathways significantly reduced viral
      episomes, suggesting that these pathways play a role in maintaining HPV episome
      stability. Inhibitors of Chk2 and DNA-PK had no effect on episome levels.
      Pharmacological inhibition of ATM proteins had no effect on episome levels, but
      ATM knockdown by siRNA significantly reduced episome levels, suggesting that ATM 
      proteins are playing an important role in HPV episome stability that does not
      require kinase activity. These results outline two pathways that trigger episome 
      loss from cells and suggest the existence of a little-understood mechanism that
      mediates viral DNA elimination. Together, our results also indicate that HPV
      episomes have a stability profile that is remarkably similar to that of fragile
      sites; these similarities are outlined and discussed. This close correspondence
      may influence the preference of HPV for integration into fragile sites.

      therapeutic for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
PG  - 758-66

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly fatal disease mandating development of
      novel, targeted therapies to elicit prolonged survival benefit to the patients.
      Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-7 (IGFBP7), a secreted protein
      belonging to the IGFBP family, functions as a potential tumor suppressor for HCC.
      In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of a
      replication-incompetent adenovirus expressing IGFBP7 (Ad.IGFBP7) in human HCC.
      Ad.IGFBP7 profoundly inhibited viability and induced apoptosis in multiple human 
      HCC cell lines by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activating a DNA
      damage response (DDR) and p38 MAPK. In orthotopic xenograft models of human HCC
      in athymic nude mice, intravenous administration of Ad.IGFBP7 profoundly
      inhibited primary tumor growth and intrahepatic metastasis. In a nude mice
      subcutaneous model, xenografts from human HCC cells were established in both
      flanks and only left-sided tumors received intratumoral injection of Ad.IGFBP7.
      Growth of both left-sided injected tumors and right-sided uninjected tumors were 
      markedly inhibited by Ad.IGFBP7 with profound suppression of angiogenesis. These 
      findings indicate that Ad.IGFBP7 might be a potent therapeutic eradicating both
      primary HCC and distant metastasis and might be an effective treatment option for
      terminal HCC patients.

AB  - Cellular senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest, accompanied by 
      and in most cases driven by a persistent DNA damage response (DDR), which may be 
      activated by uncapped telomeres or other forms of DNA damage. DNA damage foci,
      therefore, are an important part of the signaling pathway that induces cell
      senescence. however, similar foci can also be observed in proliferating cells,
      for instance as a result of replicative stress. Identifying the phenotypic
      differences between the DDR of young, proliferation-competent cells and senescent
      cells is therefore important for establishing the cellular DDR as a marker of
      senescence. Here, we describe various methods by which the DDR can be used as a
      robust marker of cellular senescence, and how to utilize a DDR marker to
      investigate the induction and stabilization of the senescent phenotype.

TI  - Cytogenetic analysis of human cells reveals specific patterns of DNA damage in
      replicative and oncogene-induced senescence.
PG  - 312-5
LID - 10.1111/acel.12034 [doi]
AB  - Senescence is thought to be triggered by DNA damage, usually indirectly assessed 
      as activation of the DNA damage response (DDR), but direct surveys of genetic
      damage are lacking. Here, we mitotically reactivate senescent human fibroblasts
      to evaluate their cytogenetic damage. We show that replicative senescence is
      generally characterized by telomeric fusions. However, both telomeric and
      extratelomeric aberrations are prevented by hTERT, indicating that even
      non-telomeric damage descends from the lack of telomerase. Compared with
      replicative senescent cells, oncogene-induced senescent fibroblasts display
      significantly higher levels of DNA damage, depicting how oncogene activation can 
      catalyze the generation of further, potentially tumorigenic, genetic damage.

TI  - Engagement of the ATR-dependent DNA damage response at the human papillomavirus
      18 replication centers during the initial amplification.
PG  - 951-64
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01943-12 [doi]
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that the human papillomavirus (HPV) genome
      replicates effectively in U2OS cells after transfection using electroporation.
      The transient extrachromosomal replication, stable maintenance, and late
      amplification of the viral genome could be studied for high- and low-risk mucosal
      and cutaneous papillomaviruses. Recent findings indicate that the cellular DNA
      damage response (DDR) is activated during the HPV life cycle and that the viral
      replication protein E1 might play a role in this process. We used a U2OS
      cell-based system to study E1-dependent DDR activation and the involvement of
      these pathways in viral transient replication. We demonstrated that the E1
      protein could cause double-strand DNA breaks in the host genome by directly
      interacting with DNA. This activity leads to the induction of an ATM-dependent
      signaling cascade and cell cycle arrest in the S and G(2) phases. However, the
      transient replication of HPV genomes in U2OS cells induces the ATR-dependent
      pathway, as shown by the accumulation of gammaH2AX, ATR-interacting protein
      (ATRIP), and topoisomerase IIbeta-binding protein 1 (TopBP1) in viral replication
      centers. Viral oncogenes do not play a role in this activation, which is induced 
      only through DNA replication or by replication proteins E1 and E2. The ATR
      pathway in viral replication centers is likely activated through DNA replication 
      stress and might play an important role in engaging cellular DNA
      repair/recombination machinery for effective replication of the viral genome upon
      active amplification.

AB  - A common feature of herpesvirus infection is activation of DNA damage responses
      (DDRs) that are essential for efficient lytic replication. Latent infection with 
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) also 
      elicit DDRs via the action of latent viral oncoproteins that deregulate cell
      proliferation and initiate a host anti-proliferative defense known as
      oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). These viruses encode auxiliary latent proteins
      that undermine OIS to allow the ongoing proliferation of infected cells despite
      robust DDR signaling. Persistent DDRs have also been linked to the aberrant
      secretion of pathogenetically important inflammatory mediators from infected
      cells. The accumulating evidence indicates that herpesviruses have evolved ways
      to co-opt DDR signaling to manage both latent and lytic phases of infection, and 
      that DDR subversion may contribute to herpesvirus-associated disease states.

TI  - Baculoviruses modulate a proapoptotic DNA damage response to promote virus
      multiplication.
PG  - 13542-53

AB  - The baculovirus Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) 
      initiates apoptosis in diverse insects through events triggered by virus DNA
      (vDNA) replication. To define the proapoptotic pathway and its role in antivirus 
      defense, we investigated the link between the host's DNA damage response (DDR)
      and apoptosis. We report here that AcMNPV elicits a DDR in the model insect
      Drosophila melanogaster. Replication of vDNA activated DDR kinases, as evidenced 
      by ATM-driven phosphorylation of the Drosophila histone H2AX homolog (H2Av), a
      critical regulator of the DDR. Ablation or inhibition of ATM repressed H2Av
      phosphorylation and blocked virus-induced apoptosis. The DDR kinase inhibitors
      caffeine and KU55933 also prevented virus-induced apoptosis in cells derived from
      the permissive AcMNPV host, Spodoptera frugiperda. This block occurred at a step 
      upstream of virus-mediated depletion of the cellular inhibitor-of-apoptosis
      protein, an event that initiates apoptosis in Spodoptera and Drosophila. Thus,
      the DDR is a conserved, proapoptotic response to baculovirus infection. DDR
      inhibition also repressed vDNA replication and reduced virus yields 100,000-fold,
      demonstrating that the DDR contributes to virus production, despite its
      recognized antivirus role. In contrast to virus-induced phosphorylation of
      Drosophila H2Av, AcMNPV blocked phosphorylation of the Spodoptera H2AX homolog
      (SfH2AX). Remarkably, AcMNPV also suppressed SfH2AX phosphorylation following
      pharmacologically induced DNA damage. These findings indicate that AcMNPV alters 
      canonical DDR signaling in permissive cells. We conclude that AcMNPV triggers a
      proapoptotic DDR that is subsequently modified, presumably to stimulate vDNA
      replication. Thus, manipulation of the DDR to facilitate multiplication is an
      evolutionarily conserved strategy among DNA viruses of insects and mammals.

TI  - Two closely related novel picornaviruses in cattle and sheep in Hungary from 2008
      to 2009, proposed as members of a new genus in the family Picornaviridae.
PG  - 13295-302
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01142-12 [doi]
AB  - Two novel picornaviruses were serendipitously identified in apparently healthy
      young domestic animals-cattle (Bos taurus) and, subsequently, sheep (Ovis
      aries)-in Hungary during 2008 and 2009. Complete genome sequencing and
      comparative analysis showed that the two viruses are related to each other and
      have identical genome organizations, VPg + 5' UTR(IRES-II)[L/1A-1B-1C-1D-2A(NPG
      downward arrowP)/2B-2C/3A-3B(VPg)-3C(pro)-3D(pol)] 3' UTR-poly(A). We suggest
      that they form two novel viral genotypes/serotypes, bovine hungarovirus 1
      (BHuV-1; GenBank accession number JQ941880) and ovine hungarovirus 1 (OHuV-1;
      GenBank accession number HM153767), which may belong to a potential novel
      picornavirus genus in the family Picornaviridae. The genome lengths of BHuV-1 and
      OHuV-1 are 7,583 and 7,588 nucleotides, each comprising a single open reading
      frame encoding 2,243 and 2,252 amino acids, respectively. In the 5' untranslated 
      regions (5' UTRs), both hungaroviruses are predicted to have a type II internal
      ribosome entry site (IRES). The nucleotide sequence and the secondary RNA
      structure of the hungarovirus IRES core domains H-I-J-K-L are highly similar to
      that of human parechovirus (HPeV) (genus Parechovirus), especially HPeV-3.
      However, in the polyprotein coding region, the amino acid sequences are more
      closely related to those of porcine teschoviruses (genus Teschovirus).
      Hungaroviruses were detected in 15% (4/26) and 25% (4/16) of the fecal samples
      from cattle and sheep, respectively. This report describes the discovery of two
      novel picornaviruses in farm animals, cattle and sheep. The mosaic genetic
      pattern raises the possibility that hungaroviruses, human parechoviruses, and
      porcine teschoviruses may be linked to each other by modular recombination of
      functional noncoding RNA elements.

TI  - Roles of ATM and ATR-mediated DNA damage responses during lytic BK polyomavirus
      infection.
PG  - e1002898
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002898 [doi]
AB  - BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is an emerging pathogen whose reactivation causes severe 
      disease in transplant patients. Unfortunately, there is no specific anti-BKPyV
      treatment available, and host cell components that affect the infection outcome
      are not well characterized. In this report, we examined the relationship between 
      BKPyV productive infection and the activation of the cellular DNA damage response
      (DDR) in natural host cells. Our results showed that both the
      ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)- and ATM and Rad-3-related (ATR)-mediated DDR
      were activated during BKPyV infection, accompanied by the accumulation of
      polyploid cells. We assessed the involvement of ATM and ATR during infection
      using small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdowns. ATM knockdown did not
      significantly affect viral gene expression, but reduced BKPyV DNA replication and
      infectious progeny production. ATR knockdown had a slightly more dramatic effect 
      on viral T antigen (TAg) and its modified forms, DNA replication, and progeny
      production. ATM and ATR double knockdown had an additive effect on DNA
      replication and resulted in a severe reduction in viral titer. While ATM mainly
      led to the activation of pChk2 and ATR was primarily responsible for the
      activation of pChk1, knockdown of all three major phosphatidylinositol
      3-kinase-like kinases (ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs) did not abolish the activation of 
      gammaH2AX during BKPyV infection. Finally, in the absence of ATM or ATR, BKPyV
      infection caused severe DNA damage and aberrant TAg staining patterns. These
      results indicate that induction of the DDR by BKPyV is critical for productive
      infection, and that one of the functions of the DDR is to minimize the DNA damage
      which is generated during BKPyV infection.

AB  - Fecal samples (N = 10) from 6- to 8-week-old wild boar piglets (Sus scrofa),
      collected from an animal park in Hungary in April 2011, were analyzed using viral
      metagenomics and complete genome sequencing. Kobuvirus (genus Kobuvirus, family
      Picornaviridae) was detected in all (100 %) specimens, with the closest
      nucleotide (89 %) and amino acid (94 %) sequence identity of the strain wild
      boar/WB1-HUN/2011/HUN (JX177612) to the prototype porcine kobuvirus S-1-HUN
      (EU787450). This study suggests that genetically highly similar (practically the 
      same geno-/serotype) porcine kobuvirus circulate in wild boars, the wildlife
      counterparts of domestic pigs. Wild boars could be an important host and
      reservoir for kobuvirus.

TI  - Terminal differentiation of cardiac and skeletal myocytes induces permissivity to
      AAV transduction by relieving inhibition imposed by DNA damage response proteins.
PG  - 2087-97
LID - 10.1038/mt.2012.144 [doi]
AB  - Gene therapy vectors based on the adeno-associated virus (AAV) are extremely
      efficient for gene transfer into post-mitotic cells of heart, muscle, brain, and 
      retina. The reason for their exquisite tropism for these cells has long remained 
      elusive. Here, we show that upon terminal differentiation, cardiac and skeletal
      myocytes downregulate proteins of the DNA damage response (DDR) and that this
      markedly induces permissivity to AAV transduction. We observed that expression of
      members of the MRN complex (Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1), which bind the incoming AAV
      genomes, faded in cardiomyocytes at ~2 weeks after birth, as well as upon
      myoblast differentiation in vitro; in both cases, withdrawal of the cells from
      the cell cycle coincided with increased AAV permissivity. Treatment of
      proliferating cells with short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against the MRN
      proteins, or with microRNA-24, which is normally upregulated upon terminal
      differentiation and negatively controls the Nbs1 levels, significantly increased 
      permissivity to AAV transduction. Consistently, delivery of these small RNAs to
      the juvenile liver concomitant with AAV markedly improved in vivo hepatocyte
      transduction. Collectively, these findings support the conclusion that cellular
      DDR proteins inhibit AAV transduction and that terminal cell differentiation
      relieves this restriction.

TI  - Human parvovirus B19 DNA replication induces a DNA damage response that is
      dispensable for cell cycle arrest at phase G2/M.
PG  - 10748-58
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01007-12 [doi]
AB  - Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection is highly restricted to human erythroid
      progenitor cells, in which it induces a DNA damage response (DDR). The DDR
      signaling is mainly mediated by the ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and
      Rad3-related) pathway, which promotes replication of the viral genome; however,
      the exact mechanisms employed by B19V to take advantage of the DDR for virus
      replication remain unclear. In this study, we focused on the initiators of the
      DDR and the role of the DDR in cell cycle arrest during B19V infection. We
      examined the role of individual viral proteins, which were delivered by
      lentiviruses, in triggering a DDR in ex vivo-expanded primary human erythroid
      progenitor cells and the role of DNA replication of the B19V double-stranded DNA 
      (dsDNA) genome in a human megakaryoblastoid cell line, UT7/Epo-S1 (S1). All the
      cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions. The results showed that none of the
      viral proteins induced phosphorylation of H2AX or replication protein A32
      (RPA32), both hallmarks of a DDR. However, replication of the B19V dsDNA genome
      was capable of inducing the DDR. Moreover, the DDR per se did not arrest the cell
      cycle at the G(2)/M phase in cells with replicating B19V dsDNA genomes. Instead, 
      the B19V nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein was the key factor in disrupting the cell 
      cycle via a putative transactivation domain operating through a p53-independent
      pathway. Taken together, the results suggest that the replication of the B19V
      genome is largely responsible for triggering a DDR, which does not perturb cell
      cycle progression at G(2)/M significantly, during B19V infection.

TI  - Coordinate regulation of DNA damage and type I interferon responses imposes an
      antiviral state that attenuates mouse gammaherpesvirus type 68 replication in
      primary macrophages.
PG  - 6899-912
LID - 10.1128/JVI.07119-11 [doi]
AB  - DNA damage response (DDR) is a sophisticated cellular network that detects and
      repairs DNA breaks. Viruses are known to activate the DDR and usurp certain DDR
      components to facilitate replication. Intriguingly, viruses also inhibit several 
      DDR proteins, suggesting that this cellular network has both proviral and
      antiviral features, with the nature of the latter still poorly understood. In
      this study we show that irradiation of primary murine macrophages was associated 
      with enhanced expression of several antiviral interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes
      (ISGs). ISG induction in irradiated macrophages was dependent on type I IFN
      signaling, a functional DNA damage sensor complex, and ataxia-telangiectasia
      mutated kinase. Furthermore, IFN regulatory factor 1 was also required for the
      optimal expression of antiviral ISGs in irradiated macrophages. Importantly,
      DDR-mediated activation of type I IFN signaling contributed to increased
      resistance to mouse gammaherpesvirus 68 replication, suggesting that the
      coordinate regulation of DDR and type I IFN signaling may have evolved as a
      component of the innate immune response to virus infections.

AB  - The family Astroviridae consists of two genera, Avastrovirus and Mamastrovirus
      whose members are associated with gastroenteritis in avian and mammalian hosts,
      respectively. In this study, we report the first detection of astrovirus from
      fecal specimens of wild boars (Sus scrofa) using viral metagenomics and complete 
      genome sequencing. The wild boar astrovirus (WBAstV-1/2011/HUN, JQ340310) genome 
      is 6707 nucleotide long and had 76%, 95% and 56% amino acid (aa) identity in the 
      ORF1a (852aa), ORF1b (522aa) and ORF2 (845aa) regions, respectively, to porcine
      astrovirus 4 (PAstV-4, JF713713), the closest match. This study indicates that
      wild boar could be a reservoir for astroviruses.

TI  - Downregulation of SMG-1 in HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma due
      to promoter hypermethylation correlates with improved survival.
PG  - 1257-67
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2058 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is linked with a subset of head and neck
      squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). HPV-positive HNSCCs show a better prognosis
      than HPV-negative HNSCCs, which may be explained by sensitivity of the
      HPV-positive HNSCCs to ionizing radiation (IR). Although the molecular mechanism 
      behind sensitivity to IR in HPV-positive HNSCCs is unresolved, DNA damage
      response (DDR) might be a significant determinant of IR sensitivity. An important
      player in the DDR, SMG-1 (suppressor with morphogenetic effect on genitalia), is 
      a potential tumor suppressor and may therefore be deregulated in cancer. No
      studies have yet been conducted linking defects in SMG-1 expression with cancer. 
      We investigated whether deregulation of SMG-1 could be responsible for defects in
      the DDR in oropharyngeal HNSCC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression and promoter
      methylation status of SMG-1 were investigated in HNSCCs. To identify a functional
      link between HPV infection and SMG-1, we transfected the HPV-negative cells with 
      an E6/E7 expression construct. SMG-1 short hairpin RNAs were expressed in
      HPV-negative cells to estimate survival upon IR. RESULTS: Forced E6/E7 expression
      in HPV-negative cells resulted in SMG-1 promoter hypermethylation and decreased
      SMG-1 expression. Due to promoter hypermethylation, HPV-positive HNSCC cells and 
      tumors express SMG-1 at lower levels than HPV-negative SCCs. Depletion of SMG-1
      in HPV-negative HNSCC cells resulted in increased radiation sensitivity, whereas 
      SMG-1 overexpression protected HPV-positive tumor cells from irradiation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Levels of SMG-1 expression negatively correlated with HPV status in 
      cancer cell lines and tumors. Diminished SMG-1 expression may contribute to the
      enhanced response to therapy exhibited by HPV-positive HNSCCs.

TI  - The DNA damage response in viral-induced cellular transformation.
PG  - 429-35
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2011.612 [doi]
AB  - The DNA damage response (DDR) has emerged as a critical tumour suppressor pathway
      responding to cellular DNA replicative stress downstream of aberrant oncogene
      over-expression. Recent studies have now implicated the DDR as a sensor of
      oncogenic virus infection. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which
      tumour viruses activate and also suppress the host DDR. The mechanism of tumour
      virus induction of the DDR is intrinsically linked to the need for these viruses 
      to promote an S-phase environment to replicate their nucleic acid during
      infection. However, inappropriate expression of viral oncoproteins can also
      activate the DDR through various mechanisms including replicative stress, direct 
      interaction with DDR components and induction of reactive oxygen species. Given
      the growth-suppressive consequences of activating the DDR, tumour viruses have
      also evolved mechanisms to attenuate these pathways. Aberrant expression of viral
      oncoproteins may therefore promote tumourigenesis through increased somatic
      mutation and aneuploidy due to DDR inactivation. This review will focus on the
      interplay between oncogenic viruses and the DDR with respect to cellular
      checkpoint control and transformation.

AB  - The family Astroviridae consists of two genera, Avastrovirus and Mamastrovirus,
      whose members are associated with gastroenteritis in avian and mammalian hosts,
      respectively. We serendipitously identified a novel ovine astrovirus in a fecal
      specimen from a domestic sheep (Ovis aries) in Hungary by viral metagenomic
      analysis. Sequencing of the fragment indicated that it was an ORF1b/ORF2/3'UTR
      sequence, and it has been submitted to the GenBank database as ovine astrovirus
      type 2 (OAstV-2/Hungary/2009) with accession number JN592482. The unique sequence
      characteristics and the phylogenetic position of OAstV-2 suggest that genetically
      divergent lineages of astroviruses exist in sheep.

      histone acetyltransferase to promote virus replication.

LID - 10.1016/j.chom.2011.08.013 [doi]
AB  - Herpesviruses, which are major human pathogens, establish life-long persistent
      infections. Although the alpha, beta, and gamma herpesviruses infect different
      tissues and cause distinct diseases, they each encode a conserved
      serine/threonine kinase that is critical for virus replication and spread. The
      extent of substrate conservation and the key common cell-signaling pathways
      targeted by these kinases are unknown. Using a human protein microarray
      high-throughput approach, we identify shared substrates of the conserved kinases 
      from herpes simplex virus, human cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and
      Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. DNA damage response (DDR) proteins were 
      statistically enriched, and the histone acetyltransferase TIP60, an upstream
      regulator of the DDR pathway, was required for efficient herpesvirus replication.
      During EBV replication, TIP60 activation by the BGLF4 kinase triggers EBV-induced
      DDR and also mediates induction of viral lytic gene expression. Identification of
      key cellular targets of the conserved herpesvirus kinases will facilitate the
      development of broadly effective antiviral strategies.

TI  - Adeno-associated virus type 2 modulates the host DNA damage response induced by
      herpes simplex virus 1 during coinfection.

AB  - Adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) is a human parvovirus that relies on a
      helper virus for efficient replication. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) supplies
      helper functions and changes the environment of the cell to promote AAV2
      replication. In this study, we examined the accumulation of cellular replication 
      and repair proteins at viral replication compartments (RCs) and the influence of 
      replicating AAV2 on HSV-1-induced DNA damage responses (DDR). We observed that
      the ATM kinase was activated in cells coinfected with AAV2 and HSV-1. We also
      found that phosphorylated ATR kinase and its cofactor ATR-interacting protein
      were recruited into AAV2 RCs, but ATR signaling was not activated. DNA-PKcs,
      another main kinase in the DDR, was degraded during HSV-1 infection in an
      ICP0-dependent manner, and this degradation was markedly delayed during AAV2
      coinfection. Furthermore, we detected phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs during AAV2 but
      not HSV-1 replication. The AAV2-mediated delay in DNA-PKcs degradation affected
      signaling through downstream substrates. Overall, our results demonstrate that
      coinfection with HSV-1 and AAV2 provokes a cellular DDR which is distinct from
      that induced by HSV-1 alone.

TI  - Gammaherpesvirus gene expression and DNA synthesis are facilitated by viral
      protein kinase and histone variant H2AX.
PG  - 73-81
LID - 10.1016/j.virol.2011.08.019 [doi]
AB  - Gammaherpesvirus protein kinases are an attractive therapeutic target as they
      support lytic replication and latency. Via an unknown mechanism these kinases
      enhance expression of select viral genes and DNA synthesis. Importantly, the
      kinase phenotypes have not been examined in primary cell types. Mouse
      gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV68) protein kinase orf36 activates the DNA damage
      response (DDR) and facilitates lytic replication in primary macrophages.
      Significantly, H2AX, a DDR component and putative orf36 substrate, enhances MHV68
      replication. Here we report that orf36 facilitated expression of RTA, an
      immediate early MHV68 gene, and DNA synthesis during de novo infection of primary
      macrophages. H2AX expression supported efficient RTA transcription and
      phosphorylated H2AX associated with RTA promoter. Furthermore, viral DNA
      synthesis was attenuated in H2AX-deficient macrophages, suggesting that the DDR
      system was exploited throughout the replication cycle. The interactions between a
      cancer-associated gammaherpesvirus and host tumor suppressor system have
      important implications for the pathogenesis of gammaherpesvirus infection.

TI  - DNA damage response signaling triggers nuclear localization of the chicken anemia
      virus protein Apoptin.
PG  - 12638-49
LID - 10.1128/JVI.05009-11 [doi]
AB  - The chicken anemia virus (CAV) protein Apoptin is a small, 13.6-kDa protein that 
      has the intriguing activity of inducing G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis specifically 
      in cancer cells by a mechanism that is independent of p53. The activity of
      Apoptin is regulated at the level of localization. Whereas Apoptin is cytoplasmic
      in primary cells and does not affect cell growth, in transformed cells it
      localizes to the nucleus, where it induces apoptosis. The properties of cancer
      cells that are responsible for activating the proapoptotic activities of Apoptin 
      remain unclear. In the current study, we show that DNA damage response (DDR)
      signaling is required to induce Apoptin nuclear localization in primary cells.
      Induction of DNA damage in combination with Apoptin expression was able to induce
      apoptosis in primary cells. Conversely, chemical or RNA interference (RNAi)
      inhibition of DDR signaling by ATM and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) was 
      sufficient to cause Apoptin to localize in the cytoplasm of transformed cells.
      Furthermore, the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity of Apoptin is required for 
      DDR-induced changes in localization. Interestingly, nuclear localization of
      Apoptin in primary cells was able to inhibit the formation of DNA damage foci
      containing 53BP1. Apoptin has been shown to bind and inhibit the
      anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). We observe that Apoptin is able to 
      inhibit formation of DNA damage foci by targeting the APC/C-associated factor
      MDC1 for degradation. We suggest that these results may point to a novel
      mechanism of DDR inhibition during viral infection.

AB  - West Nile (WNV), dengue (DENV) and yellow fever (YFV) viruses are (re)emerging,
      mosquito-borne flaviviruses that cause human disease and mortality worldwide.
      Alterations in mosquito gene expression common and unique to individual
      flaviviral infections are poorly understood. Here, we present a microarray
      analysis of the Aedes aegypti transcriptome over time during infection with DENV,
      WNV or YFV. We identified 203 mosquito genes that were >/= 5-fold differentially 
      up-regulated (DUR) and 202 genes that were >/= 10-fold differentially
      down-regulated (DDR) during infection with one of the three flaviviruses.
      Comparative analysis revealed that the expression profile of 20 DUR genes and 15 
      DDR genes was quite similar between the three flaviviruses on D1 of infection,
      indicating a potentially conserved transcriptomic signature of flaviviral
      infection. Bioinformatics analysis revealed changes in expression of genes from
      diverse cellular processes, including ion binding, transport, metabolic processes
      and peptidase activity. We also demonstrate that virally-regulated gene
      expression is tissue-specific. The overexpression of several virally
      down-regulated genes decreased WNV infection in mosquito cells and Aedes aegypti 
      mosquitoes. Among these, a pupal cuticle protein was shown to bind WNV envelope
      protein, leading to inhibition of infection in vitro and the prevention of lethal
      WNV encephalitis in mice. This work provides an extensive list of targets for
      controlling flaviviral infection in mosquitoes that may also be used to develop
      broad preventative and therapeutic measures for multiple flaviviruses.

TI  - Nuclear accumulation of the papillomavirus E1 helicase blocks S-phase progression
      and triggers an ATM-dependent DNA damage response.

AB  - Replication of the papillomavirus genome is initiated by the assembly of a
      complex between the viral E1 and E2 proteins at the origin. The E1 helicase is
      comprised of a C-terminal ATPase/helicase domain, a central domain that binds to 
      the origin, and an N-terminal regulatory region that contains nuclear import and 
      export signals mediating its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. We previously reported 
      that nuclear accumulation of E1 has a deleterious effect on cellular
      proliferation which can be prevented by its nuclear export. Here we have shown
      that nuclear accumulation of E1 from different papillomavirus types blocks cell
      cycle progression in early S phase and triggers the activation of a DNA damage
      response (DDR) and of the ATM pathway in a manner that requires both the
      origin-binding and ATPase activities of E1. Complex formation with E2 reduces the
      ability of E1 to induce a DDR but does not prevent cell cycle arrest. Transient
      viral DNA replication still occurs in S-phase-arrested cells but surprisingly is 
      neither affected by nor dependent on induction of a DDR and of the ATM kinase.
      Finally, we provide evidence that a DDR is also induced in human papillomavirus
      type 31 (HPV31)-immortalized keratinocytes expressing a mutant E1 protein
      defective for nuclear export. We propose that nuclear export of E1 prevents cell 
      cycle arrest and the induction of a DDR during the episomal maintenance phase of 
      the viral life cycle and that complex formation with E2 further safeguards
      undifferentiated cells from undergoing a DDR when E1 is in the nucleus.

TI  - [Clinical significance and the first identification of human parechoviruses in
      Hungary].
PG  - 1007-12
LID - 10.1556/OH.2011.29144 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Human parechoviruses (HPeV) belonging to the family Picornaviridae
      are widespread enteric pathogens and are associated with various clinical
      syndromes in human. At present, 16 HPeV genotypes (HPeV1-16) are known. There is 
      no report on the detection of HPeVs in Central Europe. AIMS: The aim of the
      retrospective study was to detect and characterize HPeVs using molecular methods 
      in cell cultures with "enterovirus-like" cytophatic effect (CPE) archived between
      1990 and 2004, in two virology laboratories, in Hungary. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      In Laboratory I, fecal samples from children with symptoms of gastroenteritis
      under the age of 10 years were cultured as a previous routine diagnostic
      laboratory protocol for "enterovirus". Cell cultures indicating CPE were archived
      between 1990 and 2000. In Laboratory II, 2 fecal samples, a liquor and a
      nasopharyngeal aspirate were re-tested which contained an "enterovirus-like"
      virus in cell cultures and were positive by HPeV1 neutralization immunosera
      between 2000 and 2004. Specimens were tested retrospectively for HPeV by reverse 
      transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) method using 5'UTR conserved primers. Specific primers
      were designed to determine the HPeV structural region (VP0-VP3-VP1). RESULTS: 9
      of the 66 archived samples (9.1%) from Laboratory I and all the 4 samples from
      Laboratory II were found to be HPeV-positive. 10 samples were identified as
      HPeV1, 2 were HPeV4 and 1 could not be determined. 3 HPeV1 clusters were
      identified in Laboratory I according to the isolation date originated from years 
      1990/1991, 1992/1995 and 1998. HPeV1 was detected in clinical syndromes:
      gastroenteritis (in a 24-years-old adult), recurrent stomatitis aphtosa (in a
      42-years-old adult), encephalitis and ataxia cerebellaris acuta in infants and
      children in Laboratory II. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first detection of HPeVs in
      Central Europe. Detection and genetic characterization of HPeV in available
      historical samples infected with previously unidentifiable agents with
      "enterovirus-like" cytopathogenic effect may help to understand the clinical
      importance and spectrum of the infections and the genetic diversity and evolution
      of these viruses.

      cytomegalovirus.

LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001342 [doi]
AB  - DNA damage resulting from intrinsic or extrinsic sources activates DNA damage
      responses (DDRs) centered on protein kinase signaling cascades. The usual
      consequences of inducing DDRs include the activation of cell cycle checkpoints
      together with repair of the damaged DNA or induction of apoptosis. Many DNA
      viruses elicit host DDRs during infection and some viruses require the DDR for
      efficient replication. However, the mechanism by which DDRs are activated by
      viral infection is poorly understood. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection
      induces a DDR centered on the activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
      protein kinase. Here we show that HCMV replication is compromised in cells with
      inactivated or depleted ATM and that ATM is essential for the host DDR early
      during infection. Likewise, a downstream target of ATM phosphorylation, H2AX,
      also contributes to viral replication. The ATM-dependent DDR is detected as
      discrete, nuclear gammaH2AX foci early in infection and can be activated by IE
      proteins. By 24 hpi, gammaH2AX is observed primarily in HCMV DNA replication
      compartments. We identified a role for the E2F1 transcription factor in mediating
      this DDR and viral replication. E2F1, but not E2F2 or E2F3, promotes the
      accumulation of gammaH2AX during HCMV infection or IE protein expression.
      Moreover, E2F1 expression, but not the expression of E2F2 or E2F3, is required
      for efficient HCMV replication. These results reveal a novel role for E2F1 in
      mediating an ATM-dependent DDR that contributes to viral replication. Given that 
      E2F activity is often deregulated by infection with DNA viruses, these
      observations raise the possibility that an E2F1-mediated mechanism of DDR
      activation may be conserved among DNA viruses.

      damage-responsive signaling pathway suppresses Epstein-Barr virus transformation 
      of primary human B cells. Cell. Host Microbe 8(6), 510-522 (2010). Viruses have
      evolved elegant strategies to manipulate the host while the host counters with
      defense systems including the interferon response, apoptosis and the DNA damage
      response (DDR). Viruses have multiple strategies for manipulating the DDR and the
      same virus can even activate or inhibit the DDR at different stages of infection.
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is implicated in several human cancers, including
      Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative
      disease and HIV-associated lymphomas. Although multiple viral proteins have been 
      implicated in EBV-associated malignancies, the cellular pathways that control
      EBV-induced transformation and tumorigenesis remain incompletely understood. In
      this study, Nikitin et al. demonstrate that early EBV infection induces a
      cellular DDR that restricts virus-mediated transformation. The EBV-encoded EBNA3C
      protein subsequently attenuates this response to favor transformation and
      immortalization of host cells.

AB  - Telomere dysfunctions, rendered through replicative attrition of telomeric DNA or
      due to the inhibition of shelterin components, are recognized as DNA
      double-stranded breaks (DSBs) by the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway. This leads 
      to the activation of DNA damage checkpoint sensors, including the
      Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, gamma-H2AX and 53BP1, the ATM and ATR
      signal-transducing kinases and downstream effectors, including Chk1, Chk2, and
      p53. Robust DNA damage response signals at dysfunctional telomeres, achieved by
      the complete deletion of TRF2 or by expressing dominant negative mutant
      TPP1(DeltaRD), can be detected by their association with gamma-H2AX and 53BP1
      forming "telomere dysfunction induced foci (TIFs)." Induction of TIFs at
      telomeres provides an opportunity to quantify the extent of telomere dysfunction 
      and monitor the signaling pathways.

      interaction.
PG  - 4778-86
LID - 10.1182/blood-2010-08-300954 [doi]
AB  - An important role for natural killer (NK) cells in the regulation of T-cell
      responses is emerging, although the receptor pairs regulating the NK-T-cell
      interaction have still not been identified. We found that superantigen-stimulated
      T cells express Nectin-2 (CD112) and poliovirus receptor (PVR; CD155), the
      ligands of the activating NK receptor DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM-1; CD226). 
      Interestingly, only PVR was present at the T cell surface, particularly on cells 
      in the S and G(2)/M phases of the cell cycle. The up-regulation of PVR expression
      involves DNA-damage response (DDR)-dependent pathways, because we found that
      pharmacologic inhibition of ATM and ATR kinases reduced PVR expression and that
      PVR was almost exclusively induced on cells expressing the DDR marker gammaH2AX. 
      Oxidative stress contributed to DDR activation, and our results showed impaired
      PVR levels in the presence of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger
      N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), being monocytes the main ROS source needed for optimal
      PVR expression on activated T cells. Interestingly, in accordance with ligand
      expression, NK cells lysed allogeneic proliferating more efficiently than
      nonproliferating T lymphocytes, with a mechanism requiring the cooperation
      between DNAM-1 and NKG2D. These results could contribute to unraveling the role
      of NK cells in the down-regulation of T-cell responses in physiologic and
      pathologic processes such as autoimmunity or GVHD.

TI  - Kobuviruses - a comprehensive review.
PG  - 32-41
LID - 10.1002/rmv.677 [doi]
AB  - Kobuviruses are members of the large and growing family Picornaviridae. Until
      now, two official, Aichi virus and Bovine kobuvirus, and one candidate kobuvirus 
      species, 'porcine kobuvirus', have been identified in human, cattle and swine,
      respectively. In addition, kobu-like viruses were detected very recently in the
      bat. Aichi virus could be one of the causative agents of gastroenteritis in
      humans, and kobuviruses probably also cause diarrhoea in cattle and swine.
      Although Aichi virus has been detected relatively infrequently (0-3%) in human
      diarrhoea, high seroprevalence, up to 80-95% at the age of 30-40, was found
      indicating the general nature of infection in different human populations. In the
      previous years, much new information has accumulated relating to kobuviruses and 
      their host species. This review summarises the current knowledge on kobuviruses
      including taxonomy, biology and viral characteristics, and covers all aspects of 
      infection including epidemiology, clinical picture, host species diversity,
      laboratory diagnosis and it gives a summary about possible future perspectives.

TI  - An ATM/Chk2-mediated DNA damage-responsive signaling pathway suppresses
      Epstein-Barr virus transformation of primary human B cells.
PG  - 510-22
LID - 10.1016/j.chom.2010.11.004 [doi]
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), an oncogenic herpesvirus that causes human
      malignancies, infects and immortalizes primary human B cells in vitro into
      indefinitely proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines, which represent a model for
      EBV-induced tumorigenesis. The immortalization efficiency is very low, suggesting
      that an innate tumor suppressor mechanism is operative. We identify the DNA
      damage response (DDR) as a major component of the underlying tumor suppressor
      mechanism. EBV-induced DDR activation was not due to lytic viral replication, nor
      did the DDR marks colocalize with latent episomes. Rather, a transient period of 
      EBV-induced hyperproliferation correlated with DDR activation. Inhibition of the 
      DDR kinases ATM and Chk2 markedly increased transformation efficiency of primary 
      B cells. Further, the viral latent oncoprotein EBNA3C was required to attenuate
      the EBV-induced DDR. We propose that heightened oncogenic activity in early cell 
      divisions activates a growth-suppressive DDR that is attenuated by viral latency 
      products to induce cell immortalization.

TI  - Parvovirus minute virus of mice induces a DNA damage response that facilitates
      viral replication.
PG  - e1001141
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001141 [doi]
AB  - Infection by DNA viruses can elicit DNA damage responses (DDRs) in host cells. In
      some cases the DDR presents a block to viral replication that must be overcome,
      and in other cases the infecting agent exploits the DDR to facilitate
      replication. We find that low multiplicity infection with the autonomous
      parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM) results in the activation of a DDR,
      characterized by the phosphorylation of H2AX, Nbs1, RPA32, Chk2 and p53. These
      proteins are recruited to MVM replication centers, where they co-localize with
      the main viral replication protein, NS1. The response is seen in both human and
      murine cell lines following infection with either the MVMp or MVMi strains.
      Replication of the virus is required for DNA damage signaling. Damage response
      proteins, including the ATM kinase, accumulate in viral-induced replication
      centers. Using mutant cell lines and specific kinase inhibitors, we show that ATM
      is the main transducer of the signaling events in the normal murine host. ATM
      inhibitors restrict MVM replication and ameliorate virus-induced cell cycle
      arrest, suggesting that DNA damage signaling facilitates virus replication,
      perhaps in part by promoting cell cycle arrest. Thus it appears that MVM exploits
      the cellular DNA damage response machinery early in infection to enhance its
      replication in host cells.

LID - 10.1007/s00705-010-0827-5 [doi]
AB  - The family Astroviridae consists of two genera, Avastrovirus and Mamastrovirus,
      whose members are associated with gastroenteritis in avian and mammalian hosts,
      respectively. We serendipitously identified a novel porcine astrovirus in a fecal
      specimen from a domestic pig (Sus scrofa domestica) in Hungary. Sequencing of a
      fragment indicated that it was an ORF1b/ORF2/3'UTR sequence, and it has been
      submitted to the database as porcine astrovirus type 2 (PAstV-2/Hungary/2007)
      with accession number GU562296. Its unique sequence characteristics and its
      phylogenetic position suggest that PAstV-2 could be an important link between
      previously reported astroviruses and that a genetically divergent lineage of
      astroviruses exist in piglets.

      gammaherpesvirus latency in vivo.
PG  - 50-61
LID - 10.1016/j.virol.2010.05.027 [doi]
AB  - Many herpesvirus-encoded protein kinases facilitate viral lytic replication.
      Importantly, the role of viral kinases in herpesvirus latency is less clear.
      Mouse gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV68)-encoded protein kinase orf36 facilitates lytic 
      replication in part through activation of the host DNA damage response (DDR).
      Here we show that MHV68 latency was attenuated in the absence of orf36
      expression. Unexpectedly, our study uncovered enzymatic activity-independent role
      of orf36 in the establishment of MHV68 latency following intraperitoneal route of
      infection. H2AX, an important DDR protein, facilitates MHV68 lytic replication
      and may be directly phosphorylated by orf36 during lytic infection. In this
      study, H2AX deficiency, whether systemic or limited to infected cells, attenuated
      the establishment of MHV68 latency in vivo. Thus, our work reveals viral
      kinase-dependent regulation of gammaherpesvirus latency and illuminates a novel
      link between H2AX, a component of a tumor suppressor DDR network, and in vivo
      latency of a cancer-associated gammaherpesvirus.

TI  - Multiple DNA damage signaling and repair pathways deregulated by simian virus 40 
      large T antigen.
PG  - 8007-20
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00334-10 [doi]
AB  - We demonstrated previously that expression of simian virus 40 (SV40) large T
      antigen (LT), without a viral origin, is sufficient to induce the hallmarks of a 
      cellular DNA damage response (DDR), such as focal accumulation of gamma-H2AX and 
      53BP1, via Bub1 binding. Here we expand our characterization of LT effects on the
      DDR. Using comet assays, we demonstrate that LT induces overt DNA damage. The
      Fanconi anemia pathway, associated with replication stress, becomes activated,
      since FancD2 accumulates in foci, and monoubiquitinated FancD2 is detected on
      chromatin. LT also induces a distinct set of foci of the homologous recombination
      repair protein Rad51 that are colocalized with Nbs1 and PML. The FancD2 and Rad51
      foci require neither Bub1 nor retinoblastoma protein binding. Strikingly,
      wild-type LT is localized on chromatin at, or near, the Rad51/PML foci, but the
      LT mutant in Bub1 binding is not localized there. SV40 infection was previously
      shown to trigger ATM activation, which facilitates viral replication. We
      demonstrate that productive infection also triggers ATR-dependent Chk1 activation
      and that Rad51 and FancD2 colocalize with LT in viral replication centers. Using 
      small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown, we demonstrate that Rad51 and, 
      to a lesser extent, FancD2 are required for efficient viral replication in vivo, 
      suggesting that homologous recombination is important for high-level
      extrachromosomal replication. Taken together, the interplay of LT with the DDR is
      more complex than anticipated, with individual domains of LT being connected to
      different subcomponents of the DDR and repair machinery.

PG  - 5057-60
LID - 10.1182/blood-2009-09-245928 [doi]
AB  - Hematologic malignancies are typically associated with leukemogenic fusion
      proteins, which are required to maintain the oncogenic state. Previous studies
      have shown that certain oncogenes that promote solid tumors, such as RAS and
      BRAF, can induce senescence in primary cells, which is thought to provide a
      barrier to tumorigenesis. In these cases, the activated oncogene elicits a DNA
      damage response (DDR), which is essential for the senescence program. Here we
      show that 3 leukemogenic fusion proteins, BCR-ABL, CBFB-MYH11, and RUNX1-ETO, can
      induce senescence in primary fibroblasts and hematopoietic progenitors.
      Unexpectedly, we find that senescence induction by BCR-ABL and CBFB-MYH11 occurs 
      through a DDR-independent pathway, whereas RUNX1-ETO induces senescence in a
      DDR-dependent manner. All 3 fusion proteins activate the p38 MAPK pathway, which 
      is required for senescence induction. Our results reveal diverse pathways for
      oncogene-induced senescence and further suggest that leukemias harbor genetic or 
      epigenetic alterations that inactivate senescence induction genes.

TI  - Incidence, diversity, and molecular epidemiology of sapoviruses in swine across
      Europe.
PG  - 363-8
LID - 10.1128/JCM.01279-09 [doi]
AB  - Porcine sapovirus is an enteric calicivirus in domestic pigs that belongs to the 
      family Caliciviridae. Some porcine sapoviruses are genetically related to human
      caliciviruses, which has raised public health concerns over animal reservoirs and
      the potential cross-species transmission of sapoviruses. We report on the
      incidence, genetic diversity, and molecular epidemiology of sapoviruses detected 
      in domestic pigs in a comprehensive study conducted in six European countries
      (Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Slovenia, and Spain) between 2004 and 2007. A 
      total of 1,050 swine fecal samples from 88 pig farms were collected and tested by
      reverse transcription-PCR for sapoviruses, and positive findings were confirmed
      by sequencing. Sapoviruses were detected in 80 (7.6%) samples collected on 39
      (44.3%) farms and in every country. The highest prevalence was seen among piglets
      aged 2 to 8 weeks, and there was no significant difference in the proportion of
      sapovirus-positive findings for healthy animals and animals with diarrhea in
      Spain and Denmark (the only countries where both healthy animals and animals with
      diarrhea were tested). On the basis of the sequence of the RNA polymerase region,
      highly heterogeneous populations of viruses representing six different genogroups
      (genogroups III, VI, VII, and VIII, including potential new genogroups IX and X) 
      were identified, with a predominance of genogroup GIII (50.6%). Genogroup VIII,
      found in five of the six countries, had the highest degree of homology (up to 66%
      at the amino acid level) to human sapovirus strains. Sapoviruses are commonly
      circulating and endemic agents in swine herds throughout Europe. Highly
      heterogeneous and potential new genogroups of sapoviruses were found in pigs;
      however, no "human-like" sapoviruses were detected.

TI  - 53BP1 represses mitotic catastrophe in syncytia elicited by the HIV-1 envelope.
PG  - 811-20
LID - 10.1038/cdd.2009.159 [doi]
AB  - p53 binding protein-1 (53BP1) participates in checkpoint signaling during the DNA
      damage response (DDR) and during mitosis. In this study we report that 53BP1
      aggregates in nuclear foci within syncytia elicited by the human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV)-1 envelope. 53BP1 aggregation occurs as a consequence of nuclear
      fusion (karyogamy (KG)). It colocalizes partially with the promyelomonocytic
      leukemia protein (PML), and the ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM), the
      two components of the DDR that mediate apoptosis induced by the HIV-1 envelope.
      ATM-dependent phosphorylation of 53BP1 on serines 25 and 1778 (53BP1S25P and
      53BP1S1778P) occurs at these DNA damage foci. 53BP1S25P was also detected in
      syncytia present in the lymph nodes or frontal brain sections from HIV-1-infected
      carriers, as well as in peripheral blood mononucleated cells from HIV-1-infected 
      individuals, correlating with viral load. Knockdown of 53BP1 caused HIV-1
      envelope-induced syncytia to enter abnormal mitoses, leading to their selective
      destruction through mitochondrion-dependent and caspase-dependent pathways. In
      conclusion, depletion of 53BP1 triggers the demise of HIV-1-elicited syncytia
      through mitotic catastrophe.

AB  - Aichi virus, genus Kobuvirus, family Picornaviridae, has been proposed as a
      causative agent of gastroenteritis in human. Although high seroprevalence has
      been detected, it has been identified in only a few cases. We report detection of
      Aichi virus in Hungary. A total of 65 stool samples were tested retrospectively, 
      collected from children with diarrhea, by reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
      reaction. One (1.5%) sample from a 3-year-old girl was positive. Besides
      diarrhea, fever, purulent conjunctivitis and respiratory symptoms were also
      present at the same time with virus shedding. The genotype A virus,
      Kobuvirus/human/Szigetvar-HUN298/2000/Hungary (FJ225407), has 96% nucleotide
      identity to Aichi virus.

TI  - Adeno-associated virus and adenovirus coinfection induces a cellular DNA damage

AB  - During adeno-associated virus and adenovirus (AAV/Ad) coinfection, accumulation
      of viral genomes and proteins can alter cellular stress responses. To determine
      how AAV/Ad coinfection affects the host we screened over 60 cellular proteins for
      their responses. AAV/Ad coinfections induce a robust DNA damage response (DDR)
      that is distinct from that induced by Ad infection alone. Using chemical
      inhibitors, deficient cell lines and siRNA knockdowns of the DDR kinases, ATM,
      ATR and DNA-PK, we determined that DNA-PK and ATM kinases are the initial
      transducers of this response. AAV/Ad coinfection induces ATM- and DNA-PK mediated
      phosphorylation of RPA2, NBS1, H2AX and the checkpoint kinases CHK1/2. Inhibition
      of one or more of the DDR kinases reduces the level of phosphorylation of
      downstream targets but does not dramatically reduce Ad or AAV protein expression.
      However, AAV DNA levels are moderately affected by kinase inhibition. These
      experiments provide new insights into the cellular responses to AAV/Ad
      coinfections.

TI  - Adeno-associated virus replication induces a DNA damage response coordinated by
      DNA-dependent protein kinase.
PG  - 6269-78
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00318-09 [doi]
AB  - The parvovirus adeno-associated virus (AAV) contains a small single-stranded DNA 
      genome with inverted terminal repeats that form hairpin structures. In order to
      propagate, AAV relies on the cellular replication machinery together with
      functions supplied by coinfecting helper viruses such as adenovirus (Ad). Here,
      we examined the host cell response to AAV replication in the context of Ad or Ad 
      helper proteins. We show that AAV and Ad coinfection activates a DNA damage
      response (DDR) that is distinct from that seen during Ad or AAV infection alone. 
      The DDR was also triggered when AAV replicated in the presence of minimal Ad
      helper proteins. We detected autophosphorylation of the kinases ataxia
      telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit
      (DNA-PKcs) and signaling to downstream targets SMC1, Chk1, Chk2, H2AX, and XRCC4 
      and multiple sites on RPA32. The Mre11 complex was not required for activation of
      the DDR to AAV infection. Additionally, we found that DNA-PKcs was the primary
      mediator of damage signaling in response to AAV replication. Immunofluorescence
      revealed that some activated damage proteins were found in a pan-nuclear pattern 
      (phosphorylated ATM, SMC1, and H2AX), while others such as DNA-PK components
      (DNA-PKcs, Ku70, and Ku86) and RPA32 accumulated at AAV replication centers.
      Although expression of the large viral Rep proteins contributed to some damage
      signaling, we observed that the full response required replication of the AAV
      genome. Our results demonstrate that AAV replication in the presence of Ad helper
      functions elicits a unique damage response controlled by DNA-PK.

TI  - The Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 promotes genomic instability via
      induction of reactive oxygen species.
PG  - 2313-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0810619106 [doi]
AB  - The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA)-1 is the only viral protein
      expressed in all EBV-carrying malignancies, but its contribution to oncogenesis
      has remained enigmatic. We show that EBNA-1 induces chromosomal aberrations, DNA 
      double-strand breaks, and engagement of the DNA damage response (DDR). These
      signs of genomic instability are associated with the production of reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) and are reversed by antioxidants. The catalytic subunit of
      the leukocyte NADPH oxidase, NOX2/gp91(phox), is transcriptionally activated in
      EBNA-1-expressing cells, whereas inactivation of the enzyme by chemical
      inhibitors or RNAi halts ROS production and DDR. These findings highlight a novel
      function of EBNA-1 and a possible mechanism by which expression of this viral
      protein could contribute to malignant transformation and tumor progression.

TI  - The Epstein-Barr virus replication and transcription activator, Rta/BRLF1,
      induces cellular senescence in epithelial cells.
PG  - 58-65
AB  - Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) replication and transcription activator (Rta/BRLF1) is
      an immediate-early transcription factor that controls the conversion of the
      latent viral genome into one undergoing lytic replication. By using a
      doxycycline-inducible expression system, the present study demonstrates that EBV 
      Rta efficiently elicits growth arrest in the human epithelial cell line HEK293.
      In cells arrested by EBV Rta, the expression of p21 (CDKN1A), p27 (CDKN1B) and
      cyclin E were increased. In contrast, the levels of cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDK6 were
      sharply decreased. Activation of the host cell DNA damage response (DDR),
      indicated by the increasing phosphorylation of H2AX and p53 Ser15, was observed
      on day 3 and day 5 after EBV Rta expression, respectively. Finally, EBV Rta
      arrested cells exhibited strong senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining
      on day 10 after doxycycline induction. Together, these results indicate that, in 
      addition to triggering viral lytic replication in epithelial cells, EBV Rta
      concurrently initiates a cellular senescence program that was previously
      undocumented. This finding, showing Rta may be centrally involved in inducing a
      host cell state amenable to efficient viral reproduction, in addition to its
      previously characterized regulation of viral transcription, provides new
      perspectives in understanding EBV pathogenesis.

TI  - Limited effectiveness of donor deferral registries for transfusion-transmitted
      disease markers.
PG  - 34-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Donor deferral registries (DDRs) detect repeat donations by
      previously deferred donors and prevent their release. The utility of DDRs has not
      been objectively demonstrated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 10.2 million 
      first-time donors to the American Red Cross from 1995 through 2002 were reviewed 
      to identify donors deferred by screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV; 0.19% of donors), hepatitis C virus (HCV; 0.55%), and hepatitis B virus
      (HBV; 0.13%). All repeat-reactive (RR) donors were deferred despite confirmatory 
      testing. Donors were notified and counseled about their test results and
      deferral. Their subsequent donation behavior was assessed. RESULTS: A total of
      414 HIV-deferred donors (2.1%), 471 HCV-deferred donors (0.8%, p < 0.001 vs. HIV 
      and HBV), and 222 HBV-deferred donors (1.6%, p < 0.01 vs. HIV) returned to donate
      despite their deferred status. For all three tests, confirmed-positive donors
      were less likely to return. Of donors originally confirmed positive, only 7
      returning donors were negative by screening (thus the repeat donation interdicted
      from distribution by the DDR): 0 HIV RR donors, 2 of 36,092 HCV RR donors, and 5 
      of 8,404 HBV RR donors. Review of the laboratory results for the HCV donors and
      one HBV donor was consistent with originally false-positive confirmation tests.
      The four other HBV confirmed-positive donors were anti-hepatitis B core
      antigen-positive on their subsequent donation, which was discarded despite the
      DDR. CONCLUSION: Of 10.2 million donors, the DDR did not prevent the release of
      any potentially dangerous blood component due to inappropriate return of donors
      deferred for HIV, HCV, and HBV tests. The effectiveness of DDRs should be
      evaluated for other deferrals.

TI  - Development of a novel dicistronic reporter-selectable hepatitis C virus replicon
      suitable for high-throughput inhibitor screening.
PG  - 95-102
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) research and drug discovery have been facilitated by the 
      introduction of cell lines with self-replicating subgenomic HCV replicons. Early 
      attempts to carry out robust, high-throughput screens (HTS) using HCV replicons
      have met with limited success. Specifically, selectable replicons have required
      laborious reverse transcription-PCR quantitation, and reporter replicons have
      generated low signal-to-noise ratios. In this study, we constructed a dicistronic
      single reporter (DSR)-selectable HCV replicon that contained a humanized Renilla 
      luciferase (hRLuc) gene separated from the selectable Neo(r) marker by a short
      peptide cleavage site. The mutations E1202G, T1280I, and S2197P were introduced
      to enhance replicative capability. A dicistronic dual-reporter HCV replicon cell 
      line (DDR) was subsequently created by transfection of Huh-7 cells with the DSR
      replicon to monitor antiviral activity and by the introduction of the firefly
      luciferase (FLuc) reporter gene into the host cell genome to monitor
      cytotoxicity. The DDR cell line demonstrated low signal variation within the HTS 
      format, with a calculated Z' value of 0.8. A pilot HTS consisting of 20 96-well
      plates with a single concentration (10 microM) of 1,760 different compounds was
      executed. Hits were defined as compounds that reduced hRLuc and FLuc signals > or
      =50 and < or =40%, respectively, relative to those in a compound-free control.
      Good reproducibility was demonstrated, with a calculated confirmation rate of
      >75%. The development of a robust, high-throughput HCV replicon assay where the
      effects of inhibitors can be monitored for antiviral activity and cytotoxicity
      should greatly facilitate HCV drug discovery.

TI  - Role of discoidin domain receptors 1 and 2 in human smooth muscle cell-mediated
      collagen remodeling: potential implications in atherosclerosis and
      lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
PG  - 1575-85
AB  - Obstructive diseases of blood vessels and the lung are characterized by
      degradation and synthesis of new extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Regulated
      remodeling of the ECM in diseases such as atherosclerosis and
      lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), both characterized by excessive accumulation of
      smooth muscle cells (SMCs), is thought to be controlled in part by cell surface
      receptors for specific ECM components. Discoidin domain receptors (DDR) 1 and 2
      represent a family of tyrosine kinase collagen receptors that are activated by
      fibrillar collagens. To test the hypothesis that DDR may be involved in ECM
      remodeling by SMCs in vivo, we analyzed DDR expression by reverse
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry and demonstrate 
      that both DDR1 and DDR2 are up-regulated in nodules of LAM as compared to normal 
      controls, and are expressed in lesions of atherosclerosis. In vitro, retroviral
      overexpression of DDR1 or DDR2 in human SMCs cultured on polymerized collagen
      gels leads to a reduction of collagen expression and induces matrix
      metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 at both mRNA and protein levels, but only DDR2 enhances
      MMP2 activation. Moreover, DDR2 overexpression increases SMC-mediated collagen
      and elastin degradation in vitro. Using laser microdissection, we extend our
      studies to the analysis of SMCs from LAM nodules where we observe higher MMP1
      expression and MMP2 activation. Taken together, these data provide evidence for
      the potential roles of DDR1 and DDR2 in the regulation of collagen turnover
      mediated by SMCs in obstructive diseases of blood vessels and the lung.

TI  - Discoidin domain receptor 1 is activated independently of beta(1) integrin.
PG  - 5779-84
AB  - Various types of collagen have been identified as potential ligands for the two
      mammalian discoidin domain receptor (DDR) tyrosine kinases, DDR1 and DDR2. It is 
      presently unclear whether collagen-induced DDR receptor activation, which occurs 
      with very slow kinetics, involves additional proteins with kinase activity or
      membrane-anchored proteins serving as coreceptors. In particular, the role of the
      collagen-binding integrins alpha(1)beta(1) or alpha(2)beta(1) in the DDR
      activation process is undefined. Here, we provide three lines of evidence
      suggesting that DDR1 signaling is distinct from integrin activation. First we
      demonstrate that the enzymatic activity of DDR1 is essential for receptor
      tyrosine phosphorylation. Collagen-induced DDR receptor autophosphorylation can
      be blocked either by a dominant negative mutant or by a preparation of
      recombinant extracellular domain. Second, we show DDR1 signals independent of the
      epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. In cells that endogenously express both
      DDR1 and the EGF receptor, stimulation with EGF does not induce DDR activation.
      Third, we detected full DDR1 activation after collagen stimulation in cells that 
      have been treated with blocking antibodies for alpha(2)beta(1) integrin or in
      cells with a targeted deletion of the beta(1) integrin gene. Finally, we show
      that overexpression of dominant negative DDR1 in the myoblast cell line C2C12
      blocks cellular differentiation and the formation of myofibers.

TI  - Shape-selective recognition of a model Okazaki fragment by
      geometrically-constrained bis-distamycins.
PG  - 507-18
AB  - Okazaki fragments represent interesting targets for the design of anticancer
      drugs because of their selective occurrence during DNA replication, a process
      often elevated in aggressive malignancies. Structural studies have indicated a
      bend occurs in the helical axis at the junction region (JR) that joins the DNA
      duplex region (DDR) and the RNA-DNA hybrid duplex region (HDR) of model Okazaki
      fragments. To identify a structural motif that provides a shape complementary to 
      the Okazaki fragment minor groove, we have investigated the binding of
      geometrically-constrained bis-distamycins to a model Okazaki fragment, [OKA],
      with a sequence derived from the genome of simian virus 40 (SV40). Both the JR
      and the DDR of [OKA] contain consecutive A/T base pairs that could accommodate
      distamycin binding. Of the six bis-distamycins selected for analysis, the two
      with a para configuration of the distamycins on the benzene or pyridine scaffold 
      bound [OKA] tightly (Kd approximately 10(-6) M from gel-shift assays; Kd
      approximately 10(-8) M from deltaT(M)) while the four with a meta orientation did
      not bind. The two mono-distamycins studied also did not bind [OKA]. Molecular
      modeling of the complex between the para bis-distamycin MT-9 and [OKA] revealed
      MT-9 adopted an S- shape complementary to the minor groove of the model Okazaki
      fragment.

TI  - Effect of cytarabine on the NMR structure of a model okazaki fragment from the
      SV40 genome.
PG  - 1166-75
AB  - Okazaki fragments occur as intermediates during lagging strand DNA replication.
      Alterations in Okazaki fragment structure may contribute to the anticancer
      activities of nucleoside analogues such as cytarabine, a potent anti-leukemic
      agent that inhibits lagging strand replication. We have determined the solution
      structures for two model Okazaki fragments, [OKA] and [ARAC]. These sequences are
      derived from a frequent initiation site for primase during replication of the
      SV-40 viral genome. The sequence of [ARAC] differs from [OKA] only by
      substitution of cytarabine for one deoxycytidine. The structure of each model
      Okazaki fragment was elucidated using NMR spectroscopy and restrained molecular
      dynamics simulations. The solution structures of [OKA] and [ARAC] each consist of
      two distinct domains: a DNA duplex region (DDR) and an RNA-DNA hybrid duplex
      region (HDR). The DDR of [OKA] adopts geometry similar to B-form except for
      variations in helical parameters, especially twist and roll, which occur in the
      purine tract, increasing base overlap among the five consecutive purines. The
      helical axes for the DDR and HDR of [OKA] are bent 22 degrees relative to one
      another. Although the local structures for the DDR and HDR of [ARAC] are similar 
      to those in [OKA] (root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) approximately 0.8, 1.7 A),
      the bending at the junction is different (41 degrees for [ARAC] vs 22 degrees for
      [OKA]). Increased helical bending of cytarabine-substituted Okazaki fragments may
      contribute to the propensity of cytarabine to inhibit elongation of the lagging
      strand during DNA replication, and in effecting anticancer activity.

TI  - The upstream, direct repeat sequence of Prague A Rous sarcoma virus is deficient 
      in mediating efficient Gag assembly and particle release.
PG  - 86-96
AB  - Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) contains two approximately 135-nt imperfect direct
      repeats composed of smaller repeats, dr1 (approximately 100 nt) and dr2
      (approximately 36 nt), that are between the env and src genes and downstream of
      src in the 3' untranslated region, respectively. It has previously been shown
      that a Prague A RSV mutant in which both dr1 sequences are deleted is defective
      at several points in the virus life cycle, including unspliced RNA and env mRNA
      stability, unspliced RNA transport, and virus particle assembly. A defect in
      unspliced RNA transport occurs because a cytoplasmic transport element is present
      within the dr1. We have suggested that the defect of particle production may
      arise from the failure of the unspliced RNA to be targeted to sites in the
      cytoplasm where its translation is favorable for Gag protein assembly. In this
      report, we have further investigated the function of the direct repeats by
      comparing virus mutants containing either a single upstream or downstream dr1
      sequence. Both mutants were delayed in replication compared to the wild-type; the
      mutant with a single upstream dr1 (delta DDR) is significantly more defective
      than the mutant with a single downstream dr1 (delta UDR). While both mutants
      appear capable of efficiently transporting unspliced RNA to the cytoplasm, the
      delta DDR mutant with only the upstream dr1 is defective in its ability to
      support Gag assembly and particle release. The replication defect cannot be
      repaired by placing the upstream dr1 at the location of the downstream dr1 in the
      3' untranslated region. A single point mutation in the upstream dr1 (U to C)
      restored replication and particle production to near normal levels. The results
      suggest that unspliced RNA transport and Gag assembly functions may be mediated
      by different elements within the dr1 and that the Prague A upstream dr1 is
      defective in the latter but not the former function.

PG  - 3769-89
AB  - A novel class of bis(heteroaryl)piperazine (BHAP) analogs which possesses the
      ability to inhibit NNRTI (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor)
      resistant recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and NNRTI resistant
      variants of HIV-1 has been identified via targeted screening. Further
      investigation of the structure-activity relationships of close congeners of these
      novel (alkylamino)piperidine BHAPs (AAP-BHAPs) led to the synthesis of several
      compounds possessing the desired phenotype (e.g., activity against recombinant
      RTs carrying the Y181C and P236L substitutions). Further structural modifications
      were required to inhibit metabolism and modulate solubility in order to obtain
      compounds with the desired biological profile as well as appropriate
      pharmaceutical properties. The AAP-BHAPs with the most suitable characteristics
      were compounds 7, 15, and 36.

TI  - Peripheral T cell response to A-gliadin in celiac disease: differential
      processing and presentation capacities of Epstein-Barr-transformed B cells and
      fibroblasts.
PG  - 75-81
AB  - Celiac disease (CD) is a small intestinal disorder characterized by the
      malabsorption of most nutrients. Disease pathogenesis appears to be associated
      with immune-mediated pathology. Susceptibility is associated with genes coding
      for DQw2 class II molecules. In the present report we investigated T cell
      responses to A-gliadin (AGL), a major alpha-gliadin component known to activate
      disease. Gliadin-specific lines were generated from a CD patient and a normal
      donor. Three major points were revealed by the analysis of these T cells: (1) On 
      the basis of mapping experiments using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lines and
      DR-transfected fibroblasts and DR-, DP-, and DQ-specific monoclonal antibodies
      (mAb), all responses appeared to be DR-restricted. Thus, in contrast to the
      strong association of disease susceptibility with DQ molecules, no DQ-restricted,
      gliadin-specific response was detectable. (2) Fine specificity analysis, using a 
      panel of synthetic peptides spanning the entire alpha-gliadin component molecule,
      revealed that the clones derived from the normal donor were DR53-restricted and
      AGL 21-40-specific, while clones derived from the CD patient were DR7-restricted 
      and peptide 1-20-specific. (3) Both whole AGL and AGL 1-20 were presented to the 
      patient-derived clones with much higher efficiency by DDR-transfected fibroblasts
      than by EBV lines. These data suggested that fibroblasts processed this
      determinant efficiently, while EBV lines were unable to do so. Indeed, analysis
      of a panel of truncated AGL 1-20 analogs revealed that peptide AGL 1-8, which
      contained the minimal T cell epitope, was presented with equal efficiency by
      fixed or irradiated EBV and irradiated DR7-transfected fibroblasts.

TI  - Structure of the beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase gene of Bacillus macerans: homologies to 
      other beta-glucanases.
PG  - 278-83
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of an 852 base pair (bp) DNA fragment containing the
      entire gene coding for thermostable beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase of Bacillus macerans
      has been determined. The bglM gene comprises an open reading frame (ORF) of 711
      bp (237 codons) starting with ATG at position 93 and extending to the
      translational stop codon TAA at position 804. The deduced amino acid sequence of 
      the mature protein shows 70% homology to published sequences of mesophilic
      beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases from B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens. The sequence
      coding for mature beta-glucanase is preceded by a putative signal peptide of 25
      amino acid residues, and a sequence resembling a ribosome-binding site (GGAGG)
      before the initiation codon. By contrast with the processed protein, the
      N-terminal amino acid sequence constituting the putative leader peptide bears no 
      or only weak homology to signal peptides of mesophilic Bacillus
      endo-beta-glucanases. The B. macerans signal peptide appears to be functional in 
      exporting the enzyme to the periplasm in E. coli. More than 50% of the whole
      glucanase activity was localized in the periplasmic space and in the supernatant.
      Whereas homology to endo-1,4-beta-glucanases is completely lacking, a weak amino 
      acid homology between the sequence surrounding the active site of phage T4
      lysozyme and a sequence spanning residues 126 through 161 of B. macerans
      endo-beta-glucanase could be identified.

PG  - 250-4
AB  - The negative staining techniques in transmission electron microscopy have been
      used as a routine tool in viral diagnosis since 30 years. In a short review,
      different preparation techniques, fields of application, advantages and
      disadvantages of electron microscopy in rapid diagnostic are discussed. The
      application of electron microscopy depends on availability of other more
      effective methods. Some viruses, specially in faecal samples, are identifiable
      only by electron microscopy till now. Sensitivity and specificity are improved by
      immune electron microscopy comprising suspension, immunosorbent and immunogold
      techniques. Using rapid embedding techniques, ultrahistology is a valuable tool
      in identifying viruses in biopsy samples, too.

      lower rate than in mice treated with the virus plus trypan blue. Since trypan
      blue is known as an inhibitor of the functions of macrophages the results point
      at an important role of this cell type in preventing infection with this
      oncogenic retrovirus. In this regard there are differences in the role of
      macrophages in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections.

PG  - 124-8
AB  - A total of 58 patients with histologically confirmed chronic viral hepatitis B
      and presence of HBsAg and HBV-DNA in the serum were randomized in a prospectively
      controlled trial. 30 patients were treated with 3 megaunits of rIFN a-2b s.c.
      thrice weekly for 4 months. 28 controls received no treatment. The post-treatment
      follow-up period consisted of 6 months. 28 patients treated and 27 controls
      completed the protocol. One female patient of the treatment group showed a
      complete response (loss of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV-DNA), 8 other patients (32%)
      revealed a partial response to therapy (loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA). Three
      patients of the control-group (11%) lost HBeAg and HBV-DNA spontaneously. This
      finding is statistically significant (p less than 0.05). The elimination of
      HBV-markers from the serum was associated with a normalization of
      aminotransferase activities in the serum. A reactivation of hepatitis was not
      observed after seroconversion.

      volunteers were immunized twice orally with an interval of 60 days with an
      influenza vaccine inactivated by x-ray using enteric-coated capsules. In an
      interval of six months ARI-symptoms were investigated. Between 13th and 17th week
      1988 an increased ARI-morbidity in the Greifswald-region was observed in which
      influenza A viruses were involved. In comparison with 312 non-immunized persons
      of the same age, sex and living area the immunized volunteers of the two groups
      showed 83.4% less sickness days. 30 persons of the non-immunized group got ill
      for totally 217 days, whereas only nine persons of the two immunized groups were 
      put on the sicklist for totally 36 days. No significant differences concerning
      the occurrence and duration of acute respiratory infections (ARI) between the two
      differently immunized groups could be observed.

      histochemical and electron microscopic studies].
PG  - 151-69
AB  - Infantile cortical hyperostosis, also known as Caffey's disease or
      Caffey-Silverman syndrome, is an uncommon clinico-pathological lesion of unknown 
      etiology and uncertain histogenesis. One of the most striking features is the
      early age of patients at the onset of the disease, showing swelling of the soft
      tissues overlaying bones, hyperirritability, and, subsequently, periosteal new
      bone production. The natural history of the disease proves to be self-limiting.
      Multiple areas are involved in the majority of cases. These polyostic forms are
      easily clinically diagnosed. But in rare monostic presentations, especially
      manifestations in the scapular region, there may be a great suspicion of a
      malignant tumor. Histologically, such lesion may also be misdiagnosed as a
      malignant neoplasm because of the great variety of microscopic appearances. This 
      study was conducted into 5 cases (biopsies from one male and four female infants,
      6 weeks to 4 months of age) to characterize the histological variability in the
      natural course of the disease. Electron microscopical investigations were
      additionally performed on two cases. Histologically, the process corresponds to
      typical ossifying periostitis. Three phases can be distinguished according to the
      main histological characteristics: 1. Acute inflammatory and proliferating phase;
      2. Osteogenic phase; 3. Phase of remodelling. The first phase is characterized by
      a loss of periost, areas showing proliferation of fibroblast-like cells, and by
      edema of surrounding musculature. Infiltration by leucocytes was occasionally
      observed and was accompanied by micro-abscesses. The osteogenic phase was
      characterized by formation of woven bone. Ultrastructurally proliferations of
      osteogenic mesenchyma were found and resulted in typical mineralization patterns 
      with matrix vesicles and interfibrillar depositions of hydroxyapatite crystals.
      Calcification of mitochondria was also detected. Viruses could not be observed.
      Only thread-like structures were found in the nuclei. At first interpretation,
      they appeared to be pathological protein depositions. However, further
      investigations will be necessary to elucidate their genesis. The pathogenesis is 
      discussed. Biopsy still remains indicated in cases of an unclear course of
      monostic disease.

      "infectious erythema (E.i.)". Both in connection with "E.i." and without typical 
      skin symptoms, transient arthralgias can be observed relatively frequently.
      Moreover, patients suffering from juvenile chronic arthritis (jcA) have now been 
      described, in whom the initial symptoms were closely related to an acute parvo B 
      19 infection. Fife of our own patients with arthropathies of different kinds and 
      a well documented acute parvovirus B 19 infection are presented here and all the 
      relevant contemporary scientific problems are discussed.

TI  - Mutagenic activity of BKV and JCV in human and other mammalian cells.
PG  - 221-33
AB  - We present data suggesting that human polyomaviruses BKV and JCV, widely
      distributed throughout human populations, are able to induce gene mutations in
      cultured cells. In this study, using different infecting agents, cell lines to be
      infected, mutation expression periods, and selection systems, we observed
      mutagenic effects of varying extent with values of spontaneous mutant frequencies
      being increased after BKV infection up to 100-fold in BHK cells (6-thioguanine
      resistance) and nearly 35-fold in virus-transformed human Lesch-Nyhan cells
      (ouabain resistance). In experiments with BKV the viral mutagenic potential was
      found to be raised both in moderately uv-irradiated cells, or when wild-type
      virus was replaced by the variant BKV-IR isolated from a human tumor. Since
      BKV-IR is defective in the expression of small-t antigen, the viral mutagenicity 
      does not require this protein to be active. BKV was shown to mutate, besides
      different established cell lines, human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Moreover,
      as demonstrated by comparing mutagenicities of DNAs from BKV, JCV, and the
      related polyomavirus SV40, the mutagenic effects of the three viruses do not
      appear to be essentially different. Implications of these findings are discussed.

PG  - 223-31
AB  - A highly specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against envelope protein
      gp51 and effectively bonding the antigen (Ag) on account of its high affinity
      from an unpurified Ag preparation was chosen for use in a double-sandwich enzyme 
      immuno-assay (EIA) for diagnosis of bovine leukaemia virus (BLV). The epitopes
      recognised in bovine sera by the gp51-specific antibodies were at the same time
      properly exposed. Some parameters of major importance to testing were optimised
      (Ab and Ag quantities, dilution of bovine sera for testing). Preliminary testing 
      of the double-sandwich EIA on selected bovine sera and comparison with both the
      immunodiffusion test and anti-BLV EIA confirmed its good diagnostic specificity
      and sensitivity. Hence, this double-sandwich EIA, developed by means of an mAB
      against gp51, on account of the possibility to use as Ag culture supernatant of
      the FLC cell line, is a sensitive, low-cost alternative to the anti-BLV EIA
      Dessau MTP which had so far been used. The double-sandwich EIA is recommended for
      use in final sanitation for its high analytical and diagnostic sensitivity.

AB  - Carrier experiments using Echo- and Influenza-viruses on denture basis resins and

      effects of disinfectant sprays Desident and Fesia-sept. The application of the
      disinfectant as spray seem to be advantageous, but is not recommendable. The
      diverse causes of this conclusion are discussed and an alternative way is
      proposed.

TI  - [The virological supervision of drinking water quality--a review].
PG  - 135-43
AB  - Drinking-water must be free of pathogenic organisms; this challenge refers to
      pathogenic viruses too. In order to control virological aspects of water quality 
      realistic and practicable monitoring procedures, esp. practical microbial assays,
      must be performed. They should include in all cases standard plate counts and
      counts of total or faecal coliform bacteria. Counts of coliphages in combination 
      with standard plate counts and counts of coliform bacteria offer a practical and 
      reliable indicator system for evaluating the virological safety of treated
      drinking-water supplies in the case of drinking-water reclaimed from contaminated
      raw water, esp. surface water.

PG  - 43-9
AB  - Lymphocytic dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV (DP-IV; E.C.3.4.14.5.) is described as a 
      marker enzyme of immunostimulant T-lymphocytes as well as functional
      characteristic of IL-2-producing cells. Mononuclear cells of periphere blood
      (MNC) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation followed by
      enzymcytochemical staining of DP-IV positive cells and measuring of DP-IV enzyme 
      activity using chromogenic substrates. As relative sign of single cell DP-IV
      activity we calculated average DP-IV activities of DP-IV positive cells. Blood
      samples from 14 patients with acute virus hepatitis, 30 cases of chronic active
      liver disease, 61 cases with liver cirrhosis of various kind and 19 patients with
      fatty liver and toxic hepatitis were investigated. As standard of comparison we
      used a group of healthy blood donors. By this way significant differences of
      described DP-IV parameters between some groups of liver disease were evident.
      Using an aetiologic classification of investigated liver diseases we found highly
      significant increased single cell activities in hepatitis-B associated cases in
      comparison to remarkable lower lower values in autoimmune cases. Different
      hypothesis about changes of lymphocytic dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV as a part of 
      disturbed immunoregulation in chronic liver diseases were discussed.

PG  - 189-97
AB  - Three peptides of main epitope of FMD virus O1-Kaufbeuren, VP1 (16, 21, 31), were
      found to induce in the 130-160 sequence range, in free and/or carrier-bonded
      form, virus-neutralising antibodies in guinea pig, rabbit, mouse, swine, and
      cattle. Five carrier proteins were tested, with thyroglobulin, next to keyhole
      limpet hemocyanin (KLH), being most effective for 16-peptides (145-160) and
      21-peptides (141-160 Tyr161). To protect guinea pig from FMD, minimum dosage of
      21-peptide was found to be 2 x 8 micrograms. The immunogenic spectrum of peptides
      and conjugates proved to be broader than that of monovalent vaccines of
      inactivated virus. Free peptides were found to be also capable in vitro of
      inhibiting virus infection.

      cytotoxicity.
PG  - 488-95
AB  - From a series of newly synthesized 3'-fluoro-modified nucleosides the
      C-5-chloro-substituted derivative of 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-fluorouridine (FddUrd) and 
      the 4-thio analogue of 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-fluorothymidine (FddUrd) emerged as the
      most efficient and selective anti-HIV agents. Their antiviral doses (ED50) proved
      to be 700-and 480-fold below their toxic doses (CD50) in MT-4 cells. The 50%
      inhibitory dose of cell proliferation of the 5-chloro-substituted FddUrd and its 
      parent agent FddUrd was found to be in the millimolar range for various other
      human cell-lines and for mouse CFU-GM. The 5'-triphosphate of FddUrd as well as
      of its 5-Chloro derivative are demonstrated to be two of the most active and
      selective inhibitors of the HIV-reverse transcriptase (IC50 = 0.07 +/- 0.01 and
      0.04 +/- 0.006 microM).

TI  - High level gene expression in mammalian cells by a nuclear T7-phase RNA
      polymerase.
PG  - 8485-93
AB  - Here we describe a novel expression system for mammalian cells which is based on 
      transcription of hybrid genes containing T7 phage promoters by a T7 phage RNA
      polymerase targeted to the nucleus of the host cells. The RNA polymerase gene of 
      T7 phage has been modified by substituting a sequence encoding the nuclear
      location signal of SV40 large T antigen for the N-terminal part of the polymerase
      gene. Expression of the modified gene is driven by the mouse metallothionein
      promoter in transfected mouse Ltk- cells resulting in high concentration of the
      polymerase in the nucleus. Nuclear T7 RNA polymerase directs efficient
      transcription of the cat gene under control of a T7 promoter. T7 constructs are
      expressed at a level at least 6 fold higher than the prototype pRSVcat. The
      unique properties of this heterologeous expression system are discussed.

TI  - Treatment of bovine leukaemia virus-infected sheep with suramin: an animal model 
      for the development of antiretroviral compounds.
PG  - 305-13
AB  - Bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) and the human T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma viruses I
      and II represent a specific group of type-C RNA tumour viruses characterized by
      the presence between the err gene and the 3'LTR of an "x" region or LOR frame,
      which codes for a protein that trans-activates the transcription of the viral
      genome. As BLV can also infect sheep and induces pre B-cell specific tumours in
      these animals, we were interested in investigating whether suramin, a potent
      inhibitor of retrovirus-associated reverse transcriptase, may inhibit the in vivo
      multiplication of BLV in sheep. The sheep were infected with 4 X 10(7) leukocytes
      from a BLV-infected cow. The animals were maedi-visna virus-negative. Viral p24
      antigen and reverse transcriptase appeared at 2 weeks and seroconversion occurred
      at 4 weeks after infection. Suramin was administered at 20 mg/kg/week from the
      10th till the 16th week after infection. During the treatment period the
      expression of p24 antigen as well as the titre of anti-p24 and anti-gp51
      antibodies were followed. Suramin treatment led to a significant, but transient, 
      disappearance of p24 antigen and did not affect the titre of anti-p24 and
      anti-gp51 antibodies. The BLV-infected sheep may serve as a useful animal model
      for the investigation of retrovirus inhibitors and the evaluation of different
      therapeutic regimens.

TI  - Study on the innocuity of the hypophyseal human growth hormone.
PG  - 133-47
AB  - The hypophyseal human growth hormone (hGH), a Raben type laboratory preparation, 
      was re-evaluated as regards its innocuity for therapeutic use. Besides the usual 
      control tests recommended by the Romanian Pharmacopoeia, the contamination of the
      hGH for clinical use with acute and slow viruses, was investigated taking into
      account the withdrawal of this hormone in many developed countries. The
      contamination was absent both with acute viruses as resulted from hemadsorption
      on cell cultures and counterimmunoelectrophoresis, and with slow viruses as
      observed from a two year-follow up of guinea pigs injected intracerebrally with
      the hGH preparation. Further, the content of the growth hormone itself as well as
      the contamination degree with other pituitary hormones was examined. The hGH-RIA 
      content was 2.23 +/- 0.13 IU/mg (means +/- SEM), range: 1.38-2.80 IU/mg (1st
      International Standard hGH 80/505-1982). The prolactin contamination assessed by 
      RIA was 187.34 +/- 37.66 ng/mg hGH, range: 28.44-385.20 ng (International
      Standard WHO: 80/541). The LH and FSH contamination as quantified by the
      Isocommerz (DDR) RIA kits was with two orders of magnitude lower than 10
      IU-LH/IU-hGH, the upper LH contamination limit considered as acceptable.
      Moreover, the proportion of the large molecular forms in the lyophilized hGH
      preparation was investigated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Corroborating
      the data obtained by these control tests with our previous experience on 149
      pituitary dwarfs treated with this hGH preparation during the interval 1964-1984,
      resulted minor risks of some dangerous side effects of hGH administration in
      children with growth hormone deficiency by possible contamination with pathogenic
      agents or with other disturbing hormones.

TI  - A radioimmunoassay detecting the bovine leukaemia virus transmembrane protein
      gp30 and anti-gp30 antibodies in the serum of cattle.
PG  - 113-20
AB  - By means of SDS PAGE we isolated from virus-infected foetal lamb kidney (FLK)
      cells a relatively homogenous envelope transmembrane protein gp30 of bovine
      leukaemia virus (BLV). As shown by a partial sequence analysis of the N-terminus 
      of this protein, our gp30 preparation contained only traces (less than 5%) of p24
      gag protein: Rabbit anti-gp30 serum did not cross react with the BLV proteins
      gp51, p12, p15(1), p15(2), and p10 but reacted weakly with the p24 polypeptide.
      125I-labelled gp30 (chloramine-T) was precipitated with the serum of BLV-infected
      cattle. Nonlabelled preparation of gp30 competitively inhibited the reaction of
      125I-labelled gp30 with the natural antibodies. We investigated 193 cattle sera
      by liquid phase radioimmunoassays (RIA) using 125I-gp30, gp51 and p24 antigens.
      Sixteen noninfected cattle sera were negative in all tests. The 177 serum samples
      of BLV-infected animals were examined to the diagnostic value of the three tests.
      Of these, 175 were positive in gp51 RIA, 172 in p24 RIA and 164 in gp30 RIA. In
      all three tests, 159 sera were positive while 18 sera, mostly coming from animals
      with normal leukocyte counts, were positive only either with gp51 or p24, or were
      double positive with either gp51/p24 or gp51/gp30. We conclude that the gp51 RIA 
      is superior to both the gp30 and the p24 RIA and that the gp30 RIA will be useful
      for investigating the role of gp30 in virus pathogenicity.

PG  - 181-5
AB  - 26 NPC patients and 47 TC patients were investigated clinically, and in the sera 
      of these patients EBV-specific antibodies were determined. No relapse occurred in
      11 patients with NPC and in 17 patients with TC during the period of 4 years. In 
      addition to the determination of antibodies we looked for EBNA in 3
      undifferentiated NPC and 4 undifferentiated TC, and for EBV-DNA in 2 of these NPC
      and one of these TC. The 3 NPC and 4 TC tested for EBNA showed this antigen in
      the cells. 2 NPC and 1 TC showed EBV-DNA with in situ hybridization technique. In
      the blot hybridization according to Southern the Eco R 1 fragment of both NPC was
      identical with the Eco R 1 fragment of the positive control of P 3 HR 1 cells.
      The 15 NPC-patients with tumour (4 with primary NPC, 11 with relapse) in the
      observation period showed higher IgA-VCA titres than the NPC patients free of
      relapse during this time. Subsequent to therapy, IgG-VCA titres decreased. Most
      of the NPC-patients with tumour during the time of testing mentioned before had
      IgA-VCA once or several times. Most of half of these patients had IgA-EA, but
      there was no patient without relapse. IgA-VCA increase and the presence of IgA-EA
      may be the first sign of a relapse. Thus, intensive research into this phenomenon
      will be required. No remarkable difference could be found in EBV-specific
      antibody patterns between TC patients without relapse and TC patients with tumour
      progression or relapse.

      increasing tendency to cell detachment. The production of virus particles under
      TPA treatment was markedly augmented, reaching 300 to 500 particles in individual
      cells. The production of particles appeared nearly random over the cell surface.

AB  - The mutagenic activity of four antiphytoviral substances was tested in reversion 
      mutagenicity assays with a set of histidine auxotrophic strains of Salmonella
      typhimurium by means of the preincubation method. A possible metabolic activation
      of the substances by cell free fractions from maize seedlings (S-14-fraction) and
      for comparison from mouse liver (S-9 mix) was examined. None of the guanidine,
      phenyl urea and thiadiazole compounds exerted mutagenic activity in the bacterial
      strains in experiments without metabolic activation. Cyanoguanidine and
      N-phenyl-N-carboxyphenylurea became mutagenic for Salmonella strain TA98 after
      metabolic activation by the S-14 plant fraction. Both substances were not
      mutagenic in the presence of S-9 mix made from mouse liver. The promutagen
      cyclophosphamide proved highly mutagenic in experiments with S-14 mediated plant 
      metabolic activation. This kind of bacterial mutagenicity assay is valuable in
      investigations of potential agrochemicals, as the examples have shown.

AB  - All histological specimens obtained from patients with Stage-Ia cervical
      carcinoma, between 1966 and 1986, were re-examined and reclassified in a
      retrospective study for the purpose of checking on the validity of prognostic
      factors with relevance to cervical carcinoma at Stage Ia. The criteria valid at
      present were satisfied by 226 cases. No accurate sub-division by sub-groups Ia1
      and Ia2 was possible by tumor measurement. Multicentric tumors were recorded in
      eight cases. Conisation proved to be an optimum approach to diagnosis of Stage-Ia
      cervical carcinoma. The percentual amount of histologically identified
      koilocytosis as an expression of preceding virus infections went up with
      significance from 13 to 34%. Maximum infiltration of 3 mm in depth was exhibited 
      by 93% all tumours, while 5 mm infiltration was recorded by seven per cent.
      Significant correlations were found to exist between depth of infiltration,
      tumour volume, shape of growth, degree of differentiation, and involvement of
      lymphatic vessels.

PG  - 537-45
AB  - The phenomenon that rHuIFN-alpha1(D) displays an apparently higher antiviral
      activity when assayed on bovine cells as compared to human cell lines was applied
      to the elucidation of the nature of recombinant HuIFN prepared in our institute. 
      These investigations were carried out by using a microtitre test, which defines
      biological activity as the IFN concentration leading to 50% inhibition of the
      cytopathic effect of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). In addition, the ability
      of IFN to diminish the reproduction of infectious viruses was monitored. The two 
      methods yielded similar results. With bovine cells, antiviral activities of the
      same order of magnitude were observed, regardless of the interferon types
      applied, i.e. rHuIFN-alpha 1, rHuIFN-alpha 2 and human leukocyte interferon. On
      human fibroblasts, however, rHuIFN-alpha 1 had an apparently 45 to 165 times
      lower activity than the other two interferons. On human WISH cells, the
      differences in apparent activity between the respective IFNs were even greater,
      with factors of up to 212 fold being observed. Still more distinctive were the
      effects on murine L 929 cells where an antiviral effect could be confirmed only
      for rHuIFN-alpha 1 whereas the other two interferons proved completely inactive.

      Coxsackie-B virus infections of infants and adults, with the nervous system being
      involved. Inflammatory processes affect both gray and white cerebral regions as
      well as the peripheral nervous system, and in adulthood they may take the form of
      severe necrotising encephalitis. Necroses of that kind may be recordable from
      various regions of the central nervous system. Notwithstanding tempestuous
      progress in the development of monoclonal antibody kits, culturing of Coxsackie
      viruses will continue to be of substantive importance to diagnosis, because of
      the small size of pathogens.

      mumol/l (N3dTTP). Kinetic analyses of suramin and HPA-23 inhibition are
      discussed. The observed inhibitory effects emphasize the suitability of BLV as a 
      model virus for investigations of retrovirus chemotherapy.

PG  - 13-21
AB  - The procedures generally used for the in vitro induction of interferon exploit
      fibroblast or leucocyte culture suspensions. Several factors and conditions
      influencing the capacity for IFN induction were studied, with the following
      results. In contrast to previous findings, optimum IFN induction was obtained at 
      37 degrees C, rather than 30 degrees C, when human fibroblasts were induced with 
      100 micrograms/ml of Poly (IC). There was a direct correlation between the dose
      of the inducing agent applied and the amount of IFN produced. Also, the cells
      were excellently super-inducible with metabolic inhibitors like actinomycin D and
      cycloheximine. In addition, priming procedures enhanced IFN induction in human
      fibroblasts. Comparing different cell types with respect to their ability to be
      induced for IFN production, we found that different cell types show great
      differences in their inducer sensitivity. Finally, the response of different cell
      culture systems was highly variable when induced with different compounds.

      of varicella-zoster virus diseases in patients with malignancies. In 13 out of 20
      patients a prompt cessation of new vesicle formation accompanied by rapid
      resolution of fever, crusting and complete epithelialisation of cutaneous lesions
      were noted. Only in few cases a prolonged recovery from the severe zoster
      occurred. When starting the treatment later than 48 hours after the onset of
      initial rash the dissemination of epithelial lesions could not be prevented. BVDU
      was well tolerated. Laboratory abnormalities were observed only in some cases and
      did not result in interruption of treatment.

TI  - [Griseochelin methyl ester, a new polyether derivative with antiviral activity].
PG  - 717-9
AB  - The methylester of griseochelin (1) is a new chemically-made antiviral derivate
      of the antibiotic griseochelin isolated from fermentations of Streptomyces
      griseus. It belongs to the polyether group and possesses antiviral activity
      against enveloped RNA and DNA viruses cultivated in chicken embryo cells (CEC),
      namely influenzavirus A/WSN, vesicularstomatitis virus (Indiana), vaccinia virus 
      (Lister) and herpes simplex hominis virus type 1 (Kupka). The methylester of
      griseochelin failed to show virucidal effects on extracellular influenza
      vacciniavirus particles or to influence virus adsorption and penetration
      processes. The antibiotic in concentrations of 125-15 micrograms/ml inhibited the
      virus-induced cytopathic effect of the above mentioned viruses and caused over 90
      per cent plaque reduction. Addition of 1 during a one-step growth cycle of
      influenzavirus A at 4 and 6 h p.i. resulted in complete suppression of virus
      multiplication at the control niveau of the virus yield accumulated to the same
      time point. A partial reversibility of the antiviral action against
      influenzavirus A could be achieved. Coxsackie A9 virus growth in human fibroblast
      cells was not affected by the inhibitor. Electron-optical observations showed a
      failure of the formation of the viral capside proteins of HSV type 1 at the
      second halftime of the replication cycle in CEC-infected and 1-treated cultures.

TI  - Expression of env sequences of the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) in the yeast
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 47-59
AB  - DNA sequences of the envelope (env) gene of the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) were 
      expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two yeast promoters, the
      repressible PHO5 promoter and the constitutive PGK promoter, were used to
      construct four expression plasmids comprising either a sequence of the surface
      antigen gp51 or a (gp51 + gp30) sequence. The expressed heterologous gene
      products were characterized by Western blot analysis and competitive
      radioimmunoassay. By means of Northern blot analysis the steady-state level of
      env-specific mRNA was analysed. The highest expression rate was obtained from
      recombinant plasmid YEpSG 94 comprising a gp51 sequence--a 630 base pair fragment
      containing 70% of the gp51 but lacking the N terminus--as well as the PHO5
      promoter including PHO5 signal sequence and the PHO5 terminator. The recombinant 
      gp51 was partially glycosylated but the PHO5 signal peptide did not seem to be
      cleaved off. No immunoreactive material could be found in the periplasm or in the
      culture medium. By means of monoclonal antibodies directed against eight
      different epitopes of viral gp51, all four sequential antigenic determinants were
      detected in the AH 216 (YEpSG 94) expression product.

PG  - 55-61
AB  - The human gene for mature interferon-alpha 1 (IFN-alpha 1) was inserted in a new 
      transcription-translation fusion vector system based on the expression and
      secretion signals of the gene for type A streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin, speA. 
      As deduced from the known nucleotide sequences of the component elements, the
      encoded IFN-alpha 1 was a fusion protein carrying an N-terminal extension of 17
      amino acids. When inserted in appropriate vectors capable of replication in
      Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus sanguis, this expression
      configuration directed the synthesis of antiviral activity in all 3 organisms, as
      judged by the cythopathic effect inhibition assay of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus. 
      In E. coli JM101, IFN activity was found mainly in the cytoplasmic protein
      fraction whereas in the gram-positive hosts, it was completely secreted into the 
      culture medium.

PG  - 691-700
AB  - Contrary to conditions in human pathology, primary pulmonary neoplasms are rare
      in animals. The so-called pulmonary adenomatosis of sheep (PAS) is of greater
      importance among the epithelial lung tumors of domestic animals. PAS is a
      chronic, lethal pneumopathy caused by an oncogenic retrovirus. It is associated
      with the category of slow virus infections for its extremely long incubation
      period. PAS is characterized as a primary multicentric epithelial neoplasm which 
      develops from proliferating alveolar pneumocytes II and non-ciliated bronchial
      epithelial cells. It has been recently classified as broncho-alveolar carcinoma
      on account of its morphological features and occasional metastasis into bronchial
      and mediastinal lymph nodes. PAS because of its similarity with human pulmonary
      carcinoma may be used as a model pneumopathy in comparative oncology.

TI  - A simple method of distinguishing the bacterial viruses T3 and T7, and a critical
      reevaluation of their heterologous and homologous exclusion.
PG  - 45-53
AB  - A method is presented allowing a clear distinction between bacterial viruses T3
      and T7 by plating on selectively permissive host cells. The indicator strains are
      Escherichia coli cells containing either cloned pif genes (exclusively permissive
      for T3) or the EcoRV DNA restriction system (permissive only for T7): The
      efficiencies of plating of the two phages on these hosts differ by more than 8
      orders of magnitude. This method was applied to reinvestigate the controversial
      question of mutual exclusion between T3 and T7. Under single-burst conditions,
      about 50% of coinfected cells (permissive for both viruses) produced T3 and T7
      progeny while about 25% reproduced only T3 and about 25% only T7. The burst size 
      of co-infected cells was slightly reduced, compared to controls infected with
      only one virus type. Homologous exclusion among T3 phages was also not seen;
      rather, there was a gene dosage effect: T3-encoded RNA polymerase activity as
      well as T3-specific RNA synthesis increased proportionally to the multiplicity of
      infection (2.5-20 plaque-forming units/cell).

PG  - 197-205
AB  - A high rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigen carriers among patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been recorded from areas of endemic HBV
      infections in Africa and Asia, but there are only rare and contradictory data for
      Europe. 12 specimens of resected liver tissue were immunohistologically
      investigated for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as well as for hepatitis B
      core antigen (HBcAg). HBsAg was contained in non-tumorous liver tissue in 66 per 
      cent of these cases. In two cases detection of HBcAg in the liver provided
      evidence to replication of the virus. HBcAg plus HBsAg were present in tumour
      tissue in one case. All of the HBV antigen carriers did not have chronic
      hepatitis. On the other hand, all patients with chronic hepatitis had HBV
      antigens in their liver tissue. HBV antigens were detectable in 7 non-cirrhotic
      livers, but were contained in only one of two cirrhotic livers. These results are
      likely to suggest a possible relevance of HBV infection to the aetiology of HCC
      even in central Europe without customary liver cirrhosis.

AB  - Persons treated with polio vaccine presumably contaminated with SV40 did not
      develop more tumors within 20 years after vaccination than did those who had
      received SV40-free vaccine. Some intracranial tumors, however, might be more
      frequent among persons who have been treated with contaminated vaccine.

AB  - 2-Amino-oxazoles with the semicyclic amidine structure are able in principle to
      form hydrogen bonds with native components for example with viral nucleic acids
      or viral enzymes. In this way the inhibition of viral replication seems to be

      the results of the antiviral agar diffusion plaque inhibition test are discussed 
      in relation to the chemical structures.

TI  - [Microbiologic aspects of inflammatory joint diseases].
PG  - 428-31
AB  - Regarding of microbiological aspects of arthritis three forms of joint diseases
      are under investigation: the septic arthritis, the reactive arthritis and the
      Rheumatoid Arthritis. In 95% of patients with septic arthritis microorganisms as 
      causative agents responsible for the disease are described: Staphylococci,
      Streptococci, some gram-negative bacteria. By an haematogenic route of infection 
      predominantly patients with immunosuppressive therapy are altered. In newborns
      and children septic arthritis is to observe more rarely. A reactive arthritis is 
      a postinfectious sterile process in dependence on an infection occurred at an
      earlier time. As etiologic agents Yersinia, Enterobacteriaceae and Campylobacter 
      have been discovered. 80% of the patients suffering such a reactive arthritis are
      carrier of the HLA-B27 system. The etiology of the Rheumatoid Arthritis is an
      open, unanswered problem. Of importance are: immunogenetic conditions, autoimmune
      phenomena, endocrinologic, dietetic and psychologic factors as well as bacteria
      and viruses as causative agents: cocci, bacilli, Diphteroids, endoparasitic
      bacteria (Listeria, L-forms, Mycoplasma, Chlamydiae), viruses (Adeno-, Mumps-,
      Measles-, ECHO-, Coxsackie-A- and B-, Hepatitis-, Cytomegalo-, Para-influenza-,
      Retro-, Parvo- and Rubella viruses). In the last years the EBV is of interest
      covering the question of a distinct virus persistence in tissues and the adequate
      limiting factors. Perhaps a defect of the hu-IFN-gamma-system might be of
      immunopathological and clinical significance.

      actinophage SLE 111. The chemically modified actinophage preparation (SLE
      111-BIO) was prevented from forming plaques by biotin-binding proteins, such as
      streptavidin and avidin. The avidin concentration at 50% inactivation of
      biotinylated actinophages was 0.5 micrograms/ml. The streptavidin assay was
      useful as pre-selection method during the screening and improvement work with
      streptavidin-producing microorganisms.

      misinterpretations since they frequently occur in combination with or resemble
      precancerous or cancerous changes. The morphological peculiarities and growth
      patterns of koilocytotic changes in the portio vaginalis uteri are described.
      Among 684 conizations performed, 169 (24.7%) were found to have features of an
      HPV-infection. Of these, 75.7% also had preneoplastic or neoplastic changes.
      Review of the cytological findings revealed that in 66.7% of the cases with
      histologically verified koilocytosis a false positive finding of malignancy had
      been recorded.

PG  - 282-96
AB  - The fundamentals of applied oncology involve essential aspects: Intensive cancer 
      prevention is necessary, which may be achieved by the elimination of certain
      environmental factors and the early recognition of premaligant and maligant
      growth processes, including an intensive fight against neglect and an extended
      health education. The WHO classification is an internationally understandable
      nomenclature. It is established and commented upon with regard to its specific
      application in practice. The importance of the dignity of tumour classes and
      types to prognosis and therapy is indicated. It is arranged in 7 qualities of
      dignity with corresponding types of neoplasms, with regard to transitional types 
      between benign and malignant tumours. The definition of 4 tumoral stages
      according to the TNM system is intended for obtaining patient groups which permit
      to compare therapeutical results. The principle and application of the different 
      therapeutical possibilites (surgical intervention, radiation therapy,
      chemotherapy, hormonotherapy, virus therapy, immunotherapy and complex treatment)
      are outlined. The rehabilitation and the after-care are of deciding individual,
      vocational and social importance to the resocialization of the tumour patients.
