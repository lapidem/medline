      PD-L1-blockade resistance in tumor.

AB  - Live regulatory T cells (Treg cells) suppress antitumor immunity, but how Treg
      cells behave in the metabolically abnormal tumor microenvironment remains
      unknown. Here we show that tumor Treg cells undergo apoptosis, and such apoptotic
      Treg cells abolish spontaneous and PD-L1-blockade-mediated antitumor T cell
      immunity. Biochemical and functional analyses show that adenosine, but not
      typical suppressive factors such as PD-L1, CTLA-4, TGF-beta, IL-35, and IL-10,
      contributes to apoptotic Treg-cell-mediated immunosuppression. Mechanistically,
      apoptotic Treg cells release and convert a large amount of ATP to adenosine via
      CD39 and CD73, and mediate immunosuppression via the adenosine and A2A pathways. 
      Apoptosis in Treg cells is attributed to their weak NRF2-associated antioxidant
      system and high vulnerability to free oxygen species in the tumor
      microenvironment. Thus, the data support a model wherein tumor Treg cells sustain
      and amplify their suppressor capacity through inadvertent death via oxidative
      stress. This work highlights the oxidative pathway as a metabolic checkpoint that
      controls Treg cell behavior and affects the efficacy of therapeutics targeting
      cancer checkpoints.

TI  - Can specific loading through exercise impart healing or regeneration of the
      intervertebral disc?

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Low back pain (LBP) is highly prevalent and presents an
      enormous cost both through direct health care and indirectly through significant 
      work and production loss. Low back pain is acknowledged widely to be a
      multifactorial pathology with a variety of symptoms, dysfunctions, and a number
      of possible sources of pain. One source that has been suspected and evidenced for
      some time is the intervertebral disc. Some degree of disc degeneration is a
      physiologic process associated with aging, however, more severe degeneration
      and/or structural abnormality may be indicative of a pathologic process or injury
      and is more commonly present in those suffering from LBP. Much like other tissues
      (ie, muscle, bone, etc.), it has been suspected that there exists an optimal
      loading strategy to promote the health of the disc. Exercise is often prescribed 
      for LBP and effectively reduces pain and disability. However, whether specific
      loading through exercise might plausibly heal or regenerate the intervertebral
      discs is unknown. PURPOSE: To examine the effects of loading on regenerative
      processes in the intervertebral disc and consider the potential for specific
      exercise to apply loading to the lumbar spine to produce these effects. STUDY
      DESIGN: A brief narrative literature review. METHODS: Studies examining the
      effects of loading on the intervertebral discs were reviewed to examine the
      plausibility of using loading through exercise to induce regeneration or healing 
      of the intervertebral disc. RESULTS: Research from animal model studies suggests 
      the existence of a dose-response relationship between loading and regenerative
      processes. Although high loading at high volumes and frequencies might accelerate
      degeneration or produce disc injury, high loading, yet of low volume and at low
      frequency appears to induce potentially regenerative mechanisms, including
      improvements in disc proteoglycan content, matrix gene expression, rate of cell
      apoptosis, and improved fluid flow and solute transport. CONCLUSIONS: Research
      suggests a dose-response relationship between loading and disc regenerative
      processes and that the loading pattern typically used in the lumbar extension
      resistance exercise interventions (high load, low volume, and low frequency)
      might impart healing or regeneration of the intervertebral discs. Future research
      should examine an exercise intervention with in vivo measurement of changes in
      disc condition. This may provide further evidence for the "black box" of
      treatment mechanisms associated with exercise interventions.

TI  - Cytoplasmic p53 couples oncogene-driven glucose metabolism to apoptosis and is a 
      therapeutic target in glioblastoma.
PG  - 1342-1351

AB  - Cross-talk among oncogenic signaling and metabolic pathways may create
      opportunities for new therapeutic strategies in cancer. Here we show that
      although acute inhibition of EGFR-driven glucose metabolism induces only minimal 
      cell death, it lowers the apoptotic threshold in a subset of patient-derived
      glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that after attenuated
      glucose consumption, Bcl-xL blocks cytoplasmic p53 from triggering intrinsic
      apoptosis. Consequently, targeting of EGFR-driven glucose metabolism in
      combination with pharmacological stabilization of p53 with the brain-penetrant
      small molecule idasanutlin resulted in synthetic lethality in orthotopic
      glioblastoma xenograft models. Notably, neither the degree of EGFR-signaling
      inhibition nor genetic analysis of EGFR was sufficient to predict sensitivity to 
      this therapeutic combination. However, detection of rapid inhibitory effects on
      [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, assessed through noninvasive positron emission 
      tomography, was an effective predictive biomarker of response in vivo. Together, 
      these studies identify a crucial link among oncogene signaling, glucose
      metabolism, and cytoplasmic p53, which may potentially be exploited for
      combination therapy in GBM and possibly other malignancies.

TI  - beta-Catenin Cooperates with CREB Binding Protein to Promote the Growth of Tumor 
      Cells.
PG  - 467-478
LID - 10.1159/000485013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: beta-catenin is an integral component of the canonical Wnt
      signaling pathway, and its mutations are an autosomal recessive cause of
      colorectal cancer (CRC), medulloblastoma (MDB), and ovarian cancer. Nevertheless,
      little is known about its function in lung cancers. METHODS: We first knocked
      down beta-catenin by siRNA to investigate its effects on lung cancer cell
      proliferation, migration and apoptosis. Then we verified the interaction between 
      beta-catenin and CREB binding protein (CBP) by immunofluoresence and
      co-immunoprecipition assays. Finally, the expression of beta-catenin and CBP in
      human lung adenocarcinoma specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry assay. 
      RESULTS: beta-catenin knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis 
      and suppressed cell migration in A549 and H460 cells accompanied by the decreased
      expression of Myc, PCNA, VEGF, CD44, MMP-9, MMP-13 and activated bax/caspase-3
      pathway. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipition and immunofluoresence analyses
      revealed that CBP interacted with beta-catenin and contributed to
      beta-catenin-mediated lung cancer cell growth. Abolishment of their interaction
      by the Wnt/beta-catenin inhibitor ICG-001 remarkably suppressed cell
      proliferation. Immunohistochemistry assay of tissue microarrays from patients
      with lung cancer indicated that both CBP and beta-catenin were highly expressed
      in tumor tissues and predicted poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study has provided new evidence for the role of beta-catenin in 
      promoting the growth of lung cancer cells through cooperation with CBP, and
      suggested that dual targeting of beta-catenin and CBP could be a potential
      therapeutic strategy in lung cancer treatment.

AB  - There is limited knowledge about the metabolic reprogramming induced by cancer
      therapies and how this contributes to therapeutic resistance. Here we show that
      although inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling markedly decreased glycolysis and 
      restrained tumor growth, these signaling and metabolic restrictions triggered
      autophagy, which supplied the metabolites required for the maintenance of
      mitochondrial respiration and redox homeostasis. Specifically, we found that
      survival of cancer cells was critically dependent on phospholipase A2 (PLA2) to
      mobilize lysophospholipids and free fatty acids to sustain fatty acid oxidation
      and oxidative phosphorylation. Consistent with this, we observed significantly
      increased lipid droplets, with subsequent mobilization to mitochondria. These
      changes were abrogated in cells deficient for the essential autophagy gene ATG5
      Accordingly, inhibition of PLA2 significantly decreased lipid droplets, decreased
      oxidative phosphorylation, and increased apoptosis. Together, these results
      describe how treatment-induced autophagy provides nutrients for cancer cell
      survival and identifies novel cotreatment strategies to override this survival
      advantage.

TI  - The deubiquitinating enzyme TNFAIP3 mediates inactivation of hepatic ASK1 and
      ameliorates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
PG  - 84-94
LID - 10.1038/nm.4453 [doi]
AB  - Activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in hepatocytes is a key
      process in the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and a promising
      target for treatment of the condition. However, the mechanism underlying ASK1
      activation is still unclear, and thus the endogenous regulators of this kinase
      remain open to be exploited as potential therapeutic targets. In screening for
      proteins that interact with ASK1 in the context of NASH, we identified the
      deubiquitinase tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) as a key
      endogenous suppressor of ASK1 activation, and we found that TNFAIP3 directly
      interacts with and deubiquitinates ASK1 in hepatocytes. Hepatocyte-specific
      ablation of Tnfaip3 exacerbated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease- and
      NASH-related phenotypes in mice, including glucose metabolism disorders, lipid
      accumulation and enhanced inflammation, in an ASK1-dependent manner. In contrast,
      transgenic or adeno-associated virus-mediated TNFAIP3 gene delivery in the liver 
      in both mouse and nonhuman primate models of NASH substantially blocked the onset
      and progression of the disease. These results implicate TNFAIP3 as a functionally
      important endogenous suppressor of ASK1 hyperactivation in the pathogenesis of
      NASH and identify it as a potential new molecular target for NASH therapy.

TI  - Current and future pharmacological therapies for NAFLD/NASH.
LID - 10.1007/s00535-017-1415-1 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease
      worldwide, and there is no approved pharmacotherapy. The efficacy of vitamin E
      and pioglitazone has been established in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a
      progressive form of NAFLD. GLP-1RA and SGLT2 inhibitors, which are currently
      approved for use in diabetes, have shown early efficacy in NASH, and also have
      beneficial cardiovascular or renal effects. Innovative NASH therapies include
      four main pathways. The first approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation.
      Medications in this approach include modulation of peroxisome
      proliferator-activator receptors (e.g., pemafibrate, elafibranor), medications
      targeting farnesoid X receptor axis [obeticholic acid; OCA)], inhibitors of de
      novo lipogenesis (aramchol, ACC inhibitor), and fibroblast growth factor-21
      analogues. A second target is oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. This
      class of drug includes apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor and
      emricasan (an irreversible caspase inhibitor). A third target is intestinal
      microbiomes and metabolic endotoxemia. Several agents are in ongoing trials,
      including IMMe124, TLR4 antagonist, and solithromycin (macrolide antibiotics).
      The final target is hepatic fibrosis, which is strongly associated with all-cause
      or liver-related mortality in NASH. Antifibrotic agents are a cysteine-cysteine
      motif chemokine receptor-2/5 antagonist (cenicriviroc; CVC) and galectin 3
      antagonist. Among a variety of medications in development, four agents such as
      OCA, elafibranor, ASK1 inhibitor, and CVC are currently being evaluated in an
      international phase 3 trial for the treatment of NASH. Within the next few years,
      the availability of therapeutic options for NASH will hopefully curb the rising
      trend of NASH-related diseases.

PG  - 123
LID - 10.1007/s11892-017-0951-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Obesity and obesity-related diseases, largely resulting from
      urbanization and behavioral changes, are now of global importance. Energy
      restriction, though, is associated with health improvements and increased
      longevity. We review some important mechanisms related to calorie limitation
      aimed at controlling of metabolic diseases, particularly diabetes. RECENT
      FINDINGS: Calorie restriction triggers a complex series of intricate events,
      including activation of cellular stress response elements, improved autophagy,
      modification of apoptosis, and alteration in hormonal balance. Intermittent
      fasting is not only more acceptable to patients, but it also prevents some of the
      adverse effects of chronic calorie restriction, especially malnutrition. There
      are many somatic and potentially psychologic benefits of fasting or intermittent 
      calorie restriction. However, some behavioral modifications related to abstinence
      of binge eating following a fasting period are crucial in maintaining the desired
      favorable outcomes.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive movement disorder of adults
      and the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease.
      Neuropathologic diagnosis of PD requires moderate-to-marked neuronal loss in the 
      ventrolateral substantia nigra pars compacta and alpha-synuclein (alphaS) Lewy
      body pathology. Nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration correlates with the 
      Parkinsonian motor features, but involvement of other peripheral and central
      nervous system regions leads to a wide range of non-motor features. Nigrostriatal
      dopaminergic neurodegeneration is shared with other parkinsonian disorders,
      including some genetic forms of parkinsonism, but many of these disorders do not 
      have Lewy bodies. An ideal animal model for PD, therefore, should exhibit
      age-dependent and progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration, motor dysfunction, 
      and abnormal alphaS pathology. Rodent models of PD using genetic or toxin based
      strategies have been widely used in the past several decades to investigate the
      pathogenesis and therapeutics of PD, but few recapitulate all the major clinical 
      and pathologic features of PD. It is likely that new strategies or better
      understanding of fundamental disease processes may facilitate development of
      better animal models. In this review, we highlight progress in generating rodent 
      models of PD based on impairments of four major cellular functions: mitochondrial
      oxidative phosphorylation, autophagy-lysosomal metabolism, ubiquitin-proteasome
      protein degradation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response. 
      We attempt to evaluate how impairment of these major cellular systems contribute 
      to PD and how they can be exploited in rodent models. In addition, we review
      recent cell biological studies suggesting a link between alphaS aggregation and
      impairment of nuclear membrane integrity, as observed during cellular models of
      apoptosis. We also briefly discuss the role of incompetent phagocytic clearance
      and how this may be a factor to consider in developing new rodent models of PD.

PG  - 57-62
LID - 10.1038/nature25005 [doi]
AB  - Transfer-RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs; also called tRNA-derived fragments) are 
      an abundant class of small non-coding RNAs whose biological roles are not well
      understood. Here we show that inhibition of a specific tsRNA, LeuCAG3'tsRNA,
      induces apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells in vitro and in a patient-derived
      orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma model in mice. This tsRNA binds at least two 
      ribosomal protein mRNAs (RPS28 and RPS15) to enhance their translation. A
      decrease in translation of RPS28 mRNA blocks pre-18S ribosomal RNA processing,
      resulting in a reduction in the number of 40S ribosomal subunits. These data
      establish a post-transcriptional mechanism that can fine-tune gene expression
      during different physiological states and provide a potential new target for
      treating cancer.

TI  - A systematic review of p53 regulation of oxidative stress in skeletal muscle.
PG  - 100-117
LID - 10.1080/13510002.2017.1416773 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: p53 is a tumor suppressor protein involved in regulating a wide array
      of signaling pathways. The role of p53 in the cell is determined by the type of
      imposed oxidative stress, its intensity and duration. The last decade of research
      has unravelled a dual nature in the function of p53 in mediating the oxidative
      stress burden. However, this is dependent on the specific properties of the
      applied stress and thus requires further analysis. METHODS: A systematic review
      was performed following an electronic search of Pubmed, Google Scholar, and
      ScienceDirect databases. Articles published in the English language between
      January 1, 1990 and March 1, 2017 were identified and isolated based on the
      analysis of p53 in skeletal muscle in both animal and cell culture models.
      RESULTS: Literature was categorized according to the modality of imposed
      oxidative stress including exercise, diet modification, exogenous oxidizing
      agents, tissue manipulation, irradiation, and hypoxia. With low to moderate
      levels of oxidative stress, p53 is involved in activating pathways that increase 
      time for cell repair, such as cell cycle arrest and autophagy, to enhance cell
      survival. However, with greater levels of stress intensity and duration, such as 
      with irradiation, hypoxia, and oxidizing agents, the role of p53 switches to
      facilitate increased cellular stress levels by initiating DNA fragmentation to
      induce apoptosis, thereby preventing aberrant cell proliferation. CONCLUSION:
      Current evidence confirms that p53 acts as a threshold regulator of cellular
      homeostasis. Therefore, within each modality, the intensity and duration are
      parameters of the oxidative stressor that must be analyzed to determine the role 
      p53 plays in regulating signaling pathways to maintain cellular health and
      function in skeletal muscle. ABBREVIATIONS: Acadl: acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, long

PG  - 153-197
LID - 10.1007/978-3-319-70178-3_9 [doi]
AB  - With aging and other muscle wasting diseases, men and women undergo similar
      pathological changes in skeletal muscle: increased inflammation, enhanced
      oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, satellite cell senescence, elevated 
      apoptosis and proteasome activity, and suppressed protein synthesis and myocyte
      regeneration. Decreased food intake and physical activity also indirectly
      contribute to muscle wasting. Sex hormones also play important roles in
      maintaining skeletal muscle homeostasis. Testosterone is a potent anabolic factor
      promoting muscle protein synthesis and muscular regeneration. Estrogens have a
      protective effect on skeletal muscle by attenuating inflammation; however, the
      mechanisms of estrogen action in skeletal muscle are less well characterized than
      those of testosterone. Age- and/or disease-induced alterations in sex hormones
      are major contributors to muscle wasting. Hence, men and women may respond
      differently to catabolic conditions because of their hormonal profiles. Here we
      review the similarities and differences between men and women with common wasting
      conditions including sarcopenia and cachexia due to cancer, end-stage renal
      disease/chronic kidney disease, liver disease, chronic heart failure, and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease based on the literature in clinical studies. In
      addition, the responses in men and women to the commonly used therapeutic agents 
      and their efficacy to improve muscle mass and function are also reviewed.

TI  - R-2HG Exhibits Anti-tumor Activity by Targeting FTO/m(6)A/MYC/CEBPA Signaling.

AB  - R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG), produced at high levels by mutant isocitrate
      dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) enzymes, was reported as an oncometabolite. We show
      here that R-2HG also exerts a broad anti-leukemic activity in vitro and in vivo
      by inhibiting leukemia cell proliferation/viability and by promoting cell-cycle
      arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically, R-2HG inhibits fat mass and
      obesity-associated protein (FTO) activity, thereby increasing global
      N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA modification in R-2HG-sensitive leukemia cells, 
      which in turn decreases the stability of MYC/CEBPA transcripts, leading to the
      suppression of relevant pathways. Ectopically expressed mutant IDH1 and S-2HG
      recapitulate the effects of R-2HG. High levels of FTO sensitize leukemic cells to
      R-2HG, whereas hyperactivation of MYC signaling confers resistance that can be
      reversed by the inhibition of MYC signaling. R-2HG also displays anti-tumor
      activity in glioma. Collectively, while R-2HG accumulated in IDH1/2 mutant
      cancers contributes to cancer initiation, our work demonstrates anti-tumor
      effects of 2HG in inhibiting proliferation/survival of FTO-high cancer cells via 
      targeting FTO/m(6)A/MYC/CEBPA signaling.

TI  - Naltrexone Inhibits IL-6 and TNFalpha Production in Human Immune Cell Subsets
      following Stimulation with Ligands for Intracellular Toll-Like Receptors.
PG  - 809
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00809 [doi]
AB  - The opioid antagonist naltrexone hydrochloride has been suggested to be a
      potential therapy at low dosage for multiple inflammatory conditions and cancers.
      Little is known about the immune-modulating effects of naltrexone, but an effect 
      on the activity of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been reported. We analyzed the
      effects of naltrexone hydrochloride on IL-6 secretion by peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro following stimulation with ligands for TLR4 and
      for the intracellular receptors TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9. Naltrexone did not affect
      cell viability or induce apoptosis of PBMC. Intracellular staining demonstrated
      that naltrexone inhibited production of IL-6 and TNFalpha by monocyte and
      plasmacytoid dendritic cell subsets within the PBMC population following
      treatment with ligands for TLR7/8 and TLR9, respectively. No effect of cytokine
      production by PBMC following stimulation of TLR4 was observed. Additionally,
      naltrexone inhibited IL-6 production in isolated monocytes and B cells after
      TLR7/8 and TLR9 stimulation, respectively, but no effect on IL-6 production in
      isolated monocytes after TLR4 stimulation was observed. These findings indicate
      that naltrexone has the potential to modulate the secretion of inflammatory
      cytokines in response to intracellular TLR activity, supporting the hypothesis
      that it may have potential for use as an immunomodulator.

TI  - The target landscape of clinical kinase drugs.
LID - eaan4368 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/science.aan4368 [doi]
AB  - Kinase inhibitors are important cancer therapeutics. Polypharmacology is commonly
      observed, requiring thorough target deconvolution to understand drug mechanism of
      action. Using chemical proteomics, we analyzed the target spectrum of 243
      clinically evaluated kinase drugs. The data revealed previously unknown targets
      for established drugs, offered a perspective on the "druggable" kinome,
      highlighted (non)kinase off-targets, and suggested potential therapeutic
      applications. Integration of phosphoproteomic data refined drug-affected
      pathways, identified response markers, and strengthened rationale for combination
      treatments. We exemplify translational value by discovering SIK2 (salt-inducible 
      kinase 2) inhibitors that modulate cytokine production in primary cells, by
      identifying drugs against the lung cancer survival marker MELK (maternal
      embryonic leucine zipper kinase), and by repurposing cabozantinib to treat
      FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia. This resource, available via the
      ProteomicsDB database, should facilitate basic, clinical, and drug discovery
      research and aid clinical decision-making.

TI  - The current status and perspectives regarding the clinical implication of
      intracellular calcium in breast cancer.
LID - 10.1002/jcp.26277 [doi]
AB  - Calcium ions (Ca(2+) ) act as second messengers in intracellular signaling.
      Ca(2+) pumps, channels, sensors, and calcium binding proteins, regulate the
      concentrations of intracellular Ca(2+) as a key regulator of important cellular
      processes such as gene expression, proliferation, differentiation, DNA repair,
      apoptosis, metastasis, and hormone secretion. Intracellular Ca(2+) also
      influences the functions of several organelles, that include: the endoplasmic
      reticulum, mitochondria, the Golgi, and cell membrane both in normal and breast
      cancer cells. In breast cancer, the disruption of intracellular: Ca(2+)
      homeostasis may cause tumor progression by affecting key factors/pathways
      including phospholipase C (PLC), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), calmodulin
      (CaM), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), calpain, calmodulin-dependent 
      protein kinase II (CaMKII), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF), poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1), estrogen, and estrogen receptor. 
      Because the foregoing molecules play crucial roles in breast cancer, the
      factors/pathways influencing intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations are putative
      targets for cancer treatment, using drugs such as Mephebrindole, Tilapia piscidin
      4, Nifetepimine, Paricalcitol, and Prednisolone. We have explored the
      factors/pathways which are related to breast cancer and Ca(2+) homeostasis and
      signaling in this review, and also discussed their potential as biomarkers for
      breast cancer staging, prognosis, and therapy.

AB  - LRRK2 mutations are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease, but
      LRRK2's normal physiological role in the brain is unclear. Here, we show that
      inactivation of LRRK2 and its functional homolog LRRK1 results in earlier
      mortality and age-dependent, selective neurodegeneration. Loss of dopaminergic
      (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and of noradrenergic
      neurons in the locus coeruleus is accompanied with increases in apoptosis,
      whereas the cerebral cortex and cerebellum are unaffected. Furthermore, selective
      age-dependent neurodegeneration is only present in LRRK(-/-), not LRRK1(-/-) or
      LRRK2(-/-) brains, and it is accompanied by increases in alpha-synuclein and
      impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Quantitative electron microscopy
      (EM) analysis revealed age-dependent increases of autophagic vacuoles in the SNpc
      of LRRK(-/-) mice before the onset of DA neuron loss. These findings revealed an 
      essential role of LRRK in the survival of DA neurons and in the regulation of the
      autophagy-lysosomal pathway in the aging brain.

AB  - One of the approaches to the research of the problem of aging is the study of
      genetic pathologies leading to accelerated aging, such as the Hutchinson-Gilford 
      progeria syndrome, Werner syndrome, and Down syndrome. Probably, this approach
      can be used in an attempt to understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying normal
      and pathological brain aging. The analysis of the current state of scientific
      knowledge about these pathologies shows that in the Hutchinson-Gilford progeria
      and Werner syndrome, the rate of brain aging is significantly lower than the rate
      of whole body aging, whereas in Down syndrome, the brain ages faster than other
      organs due to amyloid-beta accumulation and chronic oxidative stress in the brain
      tissue. The main point of a previously proposed hypothesis is that the aging of
      higher animals and humans is associated with an increased level of reactive
      oxygen species in mitochondria with age, which activates apoptosis, thus reducing
      the number of functioning cells.

AB  - Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells induce durable remissions in
      patients with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies. CARs are synthetic
      constructs that, when introduced into mature T cells, confer a second, non-major 
      histocompatibility complex-restricted specificity in addition to the endogenous T
      cell receptor (TCR). The implications of TCR activation on CAR T cell efficacy
      has not been well defined. Using an immunocompetent, syngeneic murine model of
      CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy for pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in
      which the CAR is introduced into T cells with known TCR specificity, we
      demonstrate loss of CD8 CAR T cell efficacy associated with T cell exhaustion and
      apoptosis when TCR antigen is present. CD4 CAR T cells demonstrate equivalent
      cytotoxicity to CD8 CAR T cells and, in contrast, retain in vivo efficacy despite
      TCR stimulation. Gene expression profiles confirm increased exhaustion and
      apoptosis of CD8 CAR T cells upon dual receptor stimulation compared to CD4 CAR T
      cells and indicate inherent differences between CD4 and CD8 CAR T cells in the
      use of T cell-associated signaling pathways. These results provide insights into 
      important aspects of CAR T cell immune biology and indicate opportunities to
      rationally design CAR constructs to optimize clinical efficacy.

AB  - Cancer cells frequently exhibit chromosomal abnormalities. Specific cytogenetic
      aberrations often are predictors of outcome, especially in hematologic neoplasms,
      such as monosomy 7 in myeloid malignancies. The functional consequences of
      aneuploidy at the cellular level are difficult to assess because of a lack of
      convenient markers to distinguish abnormal from diploid cells. We performed
      single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study hematopoietic stem and progenitor
      cells from the bone marrow of 4 healthy donors and 5 patients with bone marrow
      failure and chromosome gain or loss. In total, transcriptome sequences were
      obtained from 391 control cells and 588 cells from patients. We characterized
      normal hematopoiesis as binary differentiation from stem cells to erythroid and
      myeloid-lymphoid pathways. Aneuploid cells were distinguished from diploid cells 
      in patient samples by computational analyses of read fractions and gene
      expression of individual chromosomes. We confirmed assignment of aneuploidy to
      individual cells quantitatively, by copy-number variation, and qualitatively, by 
      loss of heterozygosity. When we projected patients' single cells onto the map of 
      normal hematopoiesis, diverse patterns were observed, broadly reflecting clinical
      phenotypes. Patients' monosomy 7 cells showed downregulation of genes involved in
      immune response and DNA damage checkpoint and apoptosis pathways, which may
      contribute to the clonal expansion of monosomy 7 cells with accumulated gene
      mutations. scRNA-seq is a powerful technique through which to infer the
      functional consequences of chromosome gain and loss and explore gene targets for 
      directed therapy.

TI  - NitroSynapsin therapy for a mouse MEF2C haploinsufficiency model of human autism.
PG  - 1488
LID - 10.1038/s41467-017-01563-8 [doi]
AB  - Transcription factor MEF2C regulates multiple genes linked to autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD), and human MEF2C haploinsufficiency results in ASD, intellectual
      disability, and epilepsy. However, molecular mechanisms underlying MEF2C
      haploinsufficiency syndrome remain poorly understood. Here we report that Mef2c
      (+/-)(Mef2c-het) mice exhibit behavioral deficits resembling those of human
      patients. Gene expression analyses on brains from these mice show changes in
      genes associated with neurogenesis, synapse formation, and neuronal cell death.
      Accordingly, Mef2c-het mice exhibit decreased neurogenesis, enhanced neuronal
      apoptosis, and an increased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory (E/I)
      neurotransmission. Importantly, neurobehavioral deficits, E/I imbalance, and
      histological damage are all ameliorated by treatment with NitroSynapsin, a new
      dual-action compound related to the FDA-approved drug memantine, representing an 
      uncompetitive/fast off-rate antagonist of NMDA-type glutamate receptors. These
      results suggest that MEF2C haploinsufficiency leads to abnormal brain
      development, E/I imbalance, and neurobehavioral dysfunction, which may be
      mitigated by pharmacological intervention.

TI  - Thyroid hormone inhibits lung fibrosis in mice by improving epithelial
      mitochondrial function.
PG  - 39-49
LID - 10.1038/nm.4447 [doi]
AB  - Thyroid hormone (TH) is critical for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis
      during stress responses, but its role in lung fibrosis is unknown. Here we found 
      that the activity and expression of iodothyronine deiodinase 2 (DIO2), an enzyme 
      that activates TH, were higher in lungs from patients with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis than in control individuals and were correlated with disease severity.
      We also found that Dio2-knockout mice exhibited enhanced bleomycin-induced lung
      fibrosis. Aerosolized TH delivery increased survival and resolved fibrosis in two
      models of pulmonary fibrosis in mice (intratracheal bleomycin and inducible
      TGF-beta1). Sobetirome, a TH mimetic, also blunted bleomycin-induced lung
      fibrosis. After bleomycin-induced injury, TH promoted mitochondrial biogenesis,
      improved mitochondrial bioenergetics and attenuated mitochondria-regulated
      apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. TH did not
      blunt fibrosis in Ppargc1a- or Pink1-knockout mice, suggesting dependence on
      these pathways. We conclude that the antifibrotic properties of TH are associated
      with protection of alveolar epithelial cells and restoration of mitochondrial
      function and that TH may thus represent a potential therapy for pulmonary
      fibrosis.

TI  - Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate couples glycolytic flux to activation of Ras.
PG  - 922
LID - 10.1038/s41467-017-01019-z [doi]
AB  - Yeast and cancer cells share the unusual characteristic of favoring fermentation 
      of sugar over respiration. We now reveal an evolutionary conserved mechanism
      linking fermentation to activation of Ras, a major regulator of cell
      proliferation in yeast and mammalian cells, and prime proto-oncogene product. A
      yeast mutant (tps1) with overactive influx of glucose into glycolysis and
      hyperaccumulation of Fru1,6bisP, shows hyperactivation of Ras, which causes its
      glucose growth defect by triggering apoptosis. Fru1,6bisP is a potent activator
      of Ras in permeabilized yeast cells, likely acting through Cdc25. As in yeast,
      glucose triggers activation of Ras and its downstream targets MEK and ERK in
      mammalian cells. Biolayer interferometry measurements show that physiological
      concentrations of Fru1,6bisP stimulate dissociation of the pure Sos1/H-Ras
      complex. Thermal shift assay confirms direct binding to Sos1, the mammalian
      ortholog of Cdc25. Our results suggest that the Warburg effect creates a vicious 
      cycle through Fru1,6bisP activation of Ras, by which enhanced fermentation
      stimulates oncogenic potency.Yeast and cancer cells both favor sugar fermentation
      in aerobic conditions. Here the authors describe a conserved mechanism from yeast
      to mammals where the glycolysis intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate binds
      Cdc25/Sos1 and couples increased glycolytic flux to increased Ras
      proto-oncoprotein activity.

TI  - Interferon regulatory factor 8 regulates aspase-1 expression to facilitate
      Epstein-Barr virus reactivation in response to B cell receptor stimulation and
      chemical induction.
PG  - e1006868
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006868 [doi]
AB  - Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), also known as interferon consensus
      sequence-binding protein (ICSBP), is a transcription factor of the IRF family.
      IRF8 plays a key role in normal B cell differentiation, a cellular process that
      is intrinsically associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation. However, 
      whether IRF8 regulates EBV lytic replication remains unknown. In this study, we
      utilized a CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing approach to deplete IRF8 and found that
      IRF8 depletion dramatically inhibits the reactivation of EBV upon lytic
      induction. We demonstrated that IRF8 depletion suppresses the expression of a
      group of genes involved in apoptosis and thus inhibits apoptosis induction upon
      lytic induction by B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation or chemical induction. The
      protein levels of caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-8 all dramatically decreased
      in IRF8-depleted cells, which led to reduced caspase activation and the
      stabilization of KAP1, PAX5 and DNMT3A upon BCR stimulation. Interestingly,
      caspase inhibition blocked the degradation of KAP1, PAX5 and DNMT3A, suppressed
      EBV lytic gene expression and viral DNA replication upon lytic induction,
      suggesting that the reduced caspase expression in IRF8-depleted cells contributes
      to the suppression of EBV lytic replication. We further demonstrated that IRF8
      directly regulates CASP1 (caspase-1) gene expression through targeting its gene
      promoter and knockdown of caspase-1 abrogates EBV reactivation upon lytic
      induction, partially through the stabilization of KAP1. Together our study
      suggested that, by modulating the activation of caspases and the subsequent
      cleavage of KAP1 upon lytic induction, IRF8 plays a critical role in EBV lytic
      reactivation.

TI  - p53 suppresses mutagenic RAD52 and POLtheta pathways by orchestrating DNA
      replication restart homeostasis.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.31723 [doi]
LID - e31723 [pii]
AB  - Classically, p53 tumor suppressor acts in transcription, apoptosis, and cell
      cycle arrest. Yet, replication-mediated genomic instability is integral to
      oncogenesis, and p53 mutations promote tumor progression and drug-resistance. By 
      delineating human and murine separation-of-function p53 alleles, we find that p53
      null and gain-of-function (GOF) mutations exhibit defects in restart of stalled
      or damaged DNA replication forks driving genomic instability genetically
      separable from transcription activation. By assaying protein-DNA fork
      interactions in single cells, we unveil a p53-MLL3-enabled recruitment of MRE11
      DNA replication restart nuclease. Importantly, p53 defects or depletion
      unexpectedly allow mutagenic RAD52 and POLq pathways to hijack stalled forks,
      which we find reflected in p53 defective breast-cancer patient COSMIC mutational 
      signatures. These data uncover p53 as a keystone regulator of replication
      homeostasis within a DNA restart network. Mechanistically, this has important
      implications for development of resistance in cancer therapy. Combined, these
      results define an unexpected role for p53-mediated suppression of replication
      genome instability.

TI  - High-Dose Metformin Plus Temozolomide Shows Increased Anti-tumor Effects in
      Glioblastoma In Vitro and In Vivo Compared with Monotherapy.
LID - 10.4143/crt.2017.466 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study is to investigate the efficacy of combined
      treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) and metformin for glioblastoma (GBM) in vitro
      and in vivo. Materials and Methods: We investigated the efficacy of combined
      treatment with TMZ and metformin using cell viability and apoptosis assays. A GBM
      orthotopic mice model was established by inoculation of 5x105 U87 cells and
      treated with metformin, TMZ, and the combination for 4 weeks. Western blotting
      and immunofluorescence of tumor specimens were analyzed to investigate
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AKT pathway. Results: The combination of 
      TMZ and metformin showed higher cytotoxicity than single agents in U87, U251, and
      A172 cell lines. A combination of high-dose metformin and TMZ showed the highest 
      apoptotic activity. The combination of TMZ and metformin enhanced AMPK
      phosphorylation and inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation, AKT 
      phosphorylation and p53 expression. The median survival of each group was 43.6,
      55.2, 53.2, 65.2, and 71.3 days for control, metformin treatment (2 mg/25 g/day
      or 10 mg/25 g/day), TMZ treatment (15 mg/kg/day), combination treatment with
      low-dose metformin and TMZ, and combination treatment with high-dose metformin
      and TMZ, respectively. Expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) was significantly
      decreased in tumor specimens treated with metformin and TMZ. Conclusion: The
      combination of metformin and TMZ was superior to monotherapy using metformin or
      TMZ in terms of cell viability in vitro and survival in vivo. The combination of 
      high-dose metformin and TMZ inhibited FASN expression in an orthotopic model.
      Inhibition of FASN might be a potential therapeutic target of GBM.

TI  - ASK Family Kinases Are Required for Optimal NLRP3 Inflammasome Priming.
LID - S0002-9440(17)31031-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ajpath.2017.12.006 [doi]
AB  - Activation of the multimeric inflammasome complex leads to inflammatory responses
      to biotic and abiotic triggers. The inflammasome sensor, Nod-like receptor family
      Pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), is activated by a range of stimuli and is
      tightly regulated to restrict excessive inflammation. Because NLRP3 responds
      broadly to cellular insults and regulates cell death similar to the
      stress-activated apoptosis signal-regulating kinases 1 and 2 (ASK1/2), we
      hypothesized that ASK1/2 may regulate NLRP3 activity. Though essential for
      mediating NLRP3 inflammasome activation, ASK1/2 were not required for NLRC4 or
      absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome activation. ASK1/2 was required for
      NLRP3 up-regulation following lipopolysaccharide treatment in primary bone
      marrow-derived macrophages and lung fibroblasts as well as during infection with 
      Burkholderia thailandensis and influenza virus. Consistent with reduced NLRP3
      expression in response to B. thailandensis, caspase-1 cleavage and cell death
      were reduced in infected bone marrow-derived macrophages and mice lacking ASK1/2 
      were resistant to Burkholderia intranasal infection. Single knockouts of either
      ASK1 or ASK2 revealed a partial role for both ASK1 and ASK2 in NLRP3
      up-regulation in response to LPS or B. thailandensis but ASK2 was primarily
      required to mediate lethal pathology during intranasal infection in vivo. Our
      findings identify the ASK1/2 complex as a regulator of NLRP3 activation and
      highlight a larger role for ASK2 in lung infection during B. thailandensis
      infection.

TI  - Consensus molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer are recapitulated in in vitro
      and in vivo models.
LID - 10.1038/s41418-017-0011-5 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly heterogeneous disease both from a molecular
      and clinical perspective. Several distinct molecular entities, such as
      microsatellite instability (MSI), have been defined that make up biologically
      distinct subgroups with their own clinical course. Recent data indicated that CRC
      can be best segregated into four groups called consensus molecular subtypes
      (CMS1-4), each of which has a unique biology and gene expression pattern. In
      order to develop improved, subtype-specific therapies and to gain insight into
      the molecular wiring and origin of these subtypes, reliable models are needed.
      This study was designed to determine the heterogeneity and identify the presence 
      of CMSs in a large panel of CRC cell lines, primary cultures and patient-derived 
      xenografts (PDX). We provide a repository encompassing this heterogeneity and
      moreover describe that a large part of the models can be robustly assigned to one
      of the four CMSs, independent of the stromal contribution. We subsequently
      validate our CMS stratification by functional analysis which for instance shows
      mesenchymal enrichment in CMS4 and metabolic dysregulation in CMS3. Finally, we
      observe a clear difference in sensitivity to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis,
      specifically between CMS2 and CMS4. This relates to the in vivo efficacy of
      chemotherapy, which delays outgrowth of CMS2, but not CMS4 xenografts. Combined
      our data indicate that molecular subtypes are faithfully modelled in CRC cell
      cultures and PDXs, representing tumour cell intrinsic and stable features. This
      repository provides researchers with a platform to study CRC using the existing
      heterogeneity.

TI  - Tissue-selective effects of nucleolar stress and rDNA damage in developmental
      disorders.
LID - 10.1038/nature25449 [doi]
AB  - Many craniofacial disorders are caused by heterozygous mutations in general
      regulators of housekeeping cellular functions such as transcription or ribosome
      biogenesis. Although it is understood that many of these malformations are a
      consequence of defects in cranial neural crest cells, a cell type that gives rise
      to most of the facial structures during embryogenesis, the mechanism underlying
      cell-type selectivity of these defects remains largely unknown. By exploring
      molecular functions of DDX21, a DEAD-box RNA helicase involved in control of both
      RNA polymerase (Pol) I- and II-dependent transcriptional arms of ribosome
      biogenesis, we uncovered a previously unappreciated mechanism linking nucleolar
      dysfunction, ribosomal DNA (rDNA) damage, and craniofacial malformations. Here we
      demonstrate that genetic perturbations associated with Treacher Collins syndrome,
      a craniofacial disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in components of the Pol
      I transcriptional machinery or its cofactor TCOF1 (ref. 1), lead to
      relocalization of DDX21 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, its loss from the 
      chromatin targets, as well as inhibition of rRNA processing and downregulation of
      ribosomal protein gene transcription. These effects are cell-type-selective,
      cell-autonomous, and involve activation of p53 tumour-suppressor protein. We
      further show that cranial neural crest cells are sensitized to p53-mediated
      apoptosis, but blocking DDX21 loss from the nucleolus and chromatin rescues both 
      the susceptibility to apoptosis and the craniofacial phenotypes associated with
      Treacher Collins syndrome. This mechanism is not restricted to cranial neural
      crest cells, as blood formation is also hypersensitive to loss of DDX21
      functions. Accordingly, ribosomal gene perturbations associated with
      Diamond-Blackfan anaemia disrupt DDX21 localization. At the molecular level, we
      demonstrate that impaired rRNA synthesis elicits a DNA damage response, and that 
      rDNA damage results in tissue-selective and dosage-dependent effects on
      craniofacial development. Taken together, our findings illustrate how disruption 
      in general regulators that compromise nucleolar homeostasis can result in
      tissue-selective malformations.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms of cell death: recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee
      on Cell Death 2018.
LID - 10.1038/s41418-017-0012-4 [doi]
AB  - Over the past decade, the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (NCCD) has
      formulated guidelines for the definition and interpretation of cell death from
      morphological, biochemical, and functional perspectives. Since the field
      continues to expand and novel mechanisms that orchestrate multiple cell death
      pathways are unveiled, we propose an updated classification of cell death
      subroutines focusing on mechanistic and essential (as opposed to correlative and 
      dispensable) aspects of the process. As we provide molecularly oriented
      definitions of terms including intrinsic apoptosis, extrinsic apoptosis,
      mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-driven necrosis, necroptosis,
      ferroptosis, pyroptosis, parthanatos, entotic cell death, NETotic cell death,
      lysosome-dependent cell death, autophagy-dependent cell death, immunogenic cell
      death, cellular senescence, and mitotic catastrophe, we discuss the utility of
      neologisms that refer to highly specialized instances of these processes. The
      mission of the NCCD is to provide a widely accepted nomenclature on cell death in
      support of the continued development of the field.

TI  - Oncogenic KRAS Regulates Amino Acid Homeostasis and Asparagine Biosynthesis via
      ATF4 and Alters Sensitivity to L-Asparaginase.

AB  - KRAS is a regulator of the nutrient stress response in non-small-cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). Induction of the ATF4 pathway during nutrient depletion requires AKT and
      NRF2 downstream of KRAS. The tumor suppressor KEAP1 strongly influences the
      outcome of activation of this pathway during nutrient stress; loss of KEAP1 in
      KRAS mutant cells leads to apoptosis. Through ATF4 regulation, KRAS alters amino 
      acid uptake and asparagine biosynthesis. The ATF4 target asparagine synthetase
      (ASNS) contributes to apoptotic suppression, protein biosynthesis, and mTORC1
      activation. Inhibition of AKT suppressed ASNS expression and, combined with
      depletion of extracellular asparagine, decreased tumor growth. Therefore, KRAS is
      important for the cellular response to nutrient stress, and ASNS represents a
      promising therapeutic target in KRAS mutant NSCLC.

TI  - Brain and blood metabolite signatures of pathology and progression in Alzheimer
      disease: A targeted metabolomics study.
PG  - e1002482

AB  - BACKGROUND: The metabolic basis of Alzheimer disease (AD) is poorly understood,
      and the relationships between systemic abnormalities in metabolism and AD
      pathogenesis are unclear. Understanding how global perturbations in metabolism
      are related to severity of AD neuropathology and the eventual expression of AD
      symptoms in at-risk individuals is critical to developing effective
      disease-modifying treatments. In this study, we undertook parallel metabolomics
      analyses in both the brain and blood to identify systemic correlates of
      neuropathology and their associations with prodromal and preclinical measures of 
      AD progression. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Quantitative and targeted metabolomics
      (Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ [identification and quantification] p180) assays were
      performed on brain tissue samples from the autopsy cohort of the Baltimore
      Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (N = 44, mean age = 81.33, % female = 36.36)
      from AD (N = 15), control (CN; N = 14), and "asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease"
      (ASYMAD, i.e., individuals with significant AD pathology but no cognitive
      impairment during life; N = 15) participants. Using machine-learning methods, we 
      identified a panel of 26 metabolites from two main classes-sphingolipids and
      glycerophospholipids-that discriminated AD and CN samples with accuracy,
      sensitivity, and specificity of 83.33%, 86.67%, and 80%, respectively. We then
      assayed these 26 metabolites in serum samples from two well-characterized
      longitudinal cohorts representing prodromal (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative [ADNI], N = 767, mean age = 75.19, % female = 42.63) and preclinical
      (BLSA) (N = 207, mean age = 78.68, % female = 42.63) AD, in which we tested their
      associations with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of AD-related brain
      atrophy, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathology, risk of conversion
      to incident AD, and trajectories of cognitive performance. We developed an
      integrated blood and brain endophenotype score that summarized the relative
      importance of each metabolite to severity of AD pathology and disease progression
      (Endophenotype Association Score in Early Alzheimer's Disease [EASE-AD]).
      Finally, we mapped the main metabolite classes emerging from our analyses to key 
      biological pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis. We found that distinct
      sphingolipid species including sphingomyelin (SM) with acyl residue sums C16:0,
      C18:1, and C16:1 (SM C16:0, SM C18:1, SM C16:1) and hydroxysphingomyelin with
      acyl residue sum C14:1 (SM (OH) C14:1) were consistently associated with severity
      of AD pathology at autopsy and AD progression across prodromal and preclinical
      stages. Higher log-transformed blood concentrations of all four sphingolipids in 
      cognitively normal individuals were significantly associated with increased risk 
      of future conversion to incident AD: SM C16:0 (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.430, 95%
      confidence interval [CI] = 1.703-11.520, p = 0.002), SM C16:1 (HR = 3.455, 95% CI
      = 1.516-7.873, p = 0.003), SM (OH) C14:1 (HR = 3.539, 95% CI = 1.373-9.122, p =
      0.009), and SM C18:1 (HR = 2.255, 95% CI = 1.047-4.855, p = 0.038). The
      sphingolipid species identified map to several biologically relevant pathways
      implicated in AD, including tau phosphorylation, amyloid-beta (Abeta) metabolism,
      calcium homeostasis, acetylcholine biosynthesis, and apoptosis. Our study has
      limitations: the relatively small number of brain tissue samples may have limited
      our power to detect significant associations, control for heterogeneity between
      groups, and replicate our findings in independent, autopsy-derived brain samples.
      CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel framework to identify biologically relevant brain
      and blood metabolites associated with disease pathology and progression during
      the prodromal and preclinical stages of AD. Our results show that perturbations
      in sphingolipid metabolism are consistently associated with endophenotypes across
      preclinical and prodromal AD, as well as with AD pathology at autopsy.
      Sphingolipids may be biologically relevant biomarkers for the early detection of 
      AD, and correcting perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism may be a plausible
      and novel therapeutic strategy in AD.
